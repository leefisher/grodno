      <br>
      The defendant Altenloh has been found guilty of being a joint accessory 
      to murder in two cases:<br>
      <br>
      1. the murder of at least 6,500 persons from the Bialystok ghetto and 3,500 
      individuals from Ghetto 1 in Grodno (ghetto liquidations in February 1943); 
      <br>
      <br>
      2. the murder of at least 100 persons in the Bialystok ghetto. <br>
      <br>
      The defendant Heimbach has been found guilty of being a joint accessory 
      to murder in three cases: <br>
      <br>
      1. the murder of at least 6,500 persons from the Bialystok ghetto (ghetto 
      liquidations in February 1943); <br>
      <br>
      2. the murder of at least 100 persons in the Bialystok ghetto; <br>
      <br>
      3. the murder of at least 15,000 persons from the Bialystok ghetto (ghetto 
      liquidation in August 1943). <br>
      <br>
      The defendant Errelis has been found guilty of being a joint accessory to 
      murder in two cases: <br>
      <br>
      1. the murder of at least 3,500 persons from Ghetto 1 in Grodno (ghetto 
      liquidation in February 1943); <br>
      <br>
      2. the murder of at least 15,000 persons from the Bialystok ghetto (ghetto 
      liquidation in August 1943). <br>
      <br>
      The defendant Dibus has been found guilty of being a joint accessory to 
      murder in two cases: <br>
      <br>
      1. the murder of at least 6,500 persons; <br>
      <br>
      2. the murder of at least 15,000 persons, all from the Bialystok ghetto 
      (ghetto liquidations in February and August 1943). <br>
      <br>
      The above accused have therefore been sentenced to the following penalties: 
      <br>
      <br>
      the defendant Altenloh to 8 (eight) years imprisonment;<br>
      the defendant Heimbach to 9 (nine) years imprisonment;<br>

      <a name="involve"></a> <b>2. Involvement of the Accused in the "Final Solution"</b> 
      <br>
      <br>
      The primary charge against the accused Altenloh, Heimbach, Errelis and Dibus 
      is as fol1ows: as members of the local Security Police, they were actively 
      involved, in varying degrees and extent, in the destruction of the Jews 
      from Bialystok District within the framework of the co-called "Final Solution 
      of the Jewish Question," as ordered by the National Socialist leadership 
      (Hitler, Himmler, Kaltenbrunner, Mueller). They are accused of having carried 
      out, according to orders, the removal and transport of many thousands of 
      Jews to the extermination camps Auschwitz and Treblinka from the ghettos 
      of the district: Zambrow/Lomza (Altenloh, January 1943), Grodno (Altenloh, 
      Errelis, January/February 1943), Pruzana (Altenloh, January 1943), Bialystok 
      city (Altenloh, Heimbach, Dibus, February 1943; Heimbach, Errelis, Dibus, 
      August 1943). They perpetrated these acts while being aware and cognizant 
      of the fate of death awaiting the Jews in those camps. <br>
      <br>
      In addition, the defendants are accused of having been instrumental in the 
      killing of individual Jews - in varying numbers and for various reasons, 
      acting under order or by their own will and decision - either by shooting 
      these persons themselves or ordering their murder. <br>
      <br>
      Proceedings were originally also directed against two further defendants:<br>
      1. the former Oberregierungsrat (senior councillor, Higher Civil Service) 
      and SS Obersturmbannfuehrer (Lieutenant Colonel) Dr. Zimmermann, who served 
      as head of the Commander of the Security Police (KdS) in Bialystok beginning 
      in June 1943 at the latest;<br>
      2. the former Kriminalsekretaer (Detective Lieutenant) and SS Sturmscharfuehrer 
      (Sergeant-Major) Hermann Bloch, a member of the Gestapo in Zambrow in January 
      1943. <br>
      <br>
      These two individuals committed suicide: Dr. Zimmermann on December 31, 
      1965, just before being rearrested, and Bloch on September 23, 1965, during 
      detention in Karlsruhe awaiting trial. <br>

      <a name="transport1"></a> <b>3. Transports to the Death Camps after November 
      2, 1942</b><br>
      <br>
      Removal and transport of Jews in individual instances was initiated shortly 
      after November 2. At the same time, Jews were deported from the Zichenau 
      ghetto at the nearby Gestapo border post of Zichenau-Schroettersburg. They 
      were transported to Auschwitz in eight trains, which arrived at their final 
      destination in the period from November 7 to December 11, 1942. <br>
      <br>
      In Bialystok District, initial deportations were from the Grodno area. Ghetto 
      2 in Grodno and the greater proportion of the Kelbasin camp - which was 
      not designed to quarter persons during the winter months - were liquidated, 
      and persons were deported to Auschwitz before the end of 1942 in at least 
      six train transports. These trains arrived in Auschwitz on November 9, 14, 
      18 and 25, 1942, as well as on December 2 and 8, 1942. The first and last 
      two train transports were from the Kelbasin camp, with Jews from Skiedel, 
      Sydra, Lyda, Ostryna, Grodno, Lunna and Porzeze. The middle two transports 
      contained persons from Ghetto 2 in Grodno. Orders for the transports were 
      sent from the RSHA to Dr. Altenloh; Altenloh then passed on these orders 
      to his Grodno outpost, headed by Errelis. Trains and departure dates were 
      specified in the orders. The 'official' purpose of the operation was listed 
      as 'relocation' of Jews for the purpose of conscripted labor. <br>
      <br>
      A temporary halt to transports was issued effective from December 15, 1942 
      to January 1, 1943, due to the primary logistic need of ensuring the flow 
      of supplies to Stalingrad. As far as can be ascertained, this transport 
      stoppage was circumvented only by two trains from Bialystok: train No. Pj 
      39 (Pj = Polnische Juden /Polish Jews) on December 17, 1942, destination 
      Treblinka, and the liquidation train from the Augustowo area, which arrived 
      in Auschwitz on January 7, 1943. Thus, Treblinka was already a final destination 
      for such transports in 1942, even though perhaps only on rare occasion. 
      In any event, it is possible to conclude on the basis of the empty train 
      No. LP Pj 30, from Treblinka to Biaylstok and Grodno on November 29, 1942 
      - by comparison of the routing number with the fully loaded train Pj 39 
      - that there were a number of transports in this series. Moreover, it is 
      clear that Centipolk was liquidated during this period, and probably on 
      into January 1943, and its inhabitants transported to Treblinka. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Basis for Proof. Evaluation of Evidence.</b> <br>
      <br>
      These findings are based, aside from the already mentioned documents, on 
      testimony presented by the defendants Altenloh, Errelis and Dibus, insofar 
      as this was credible, and testimony by the witnesses Graf von der Groeben, 
      Hieronymus, Tubenthal, Dr. Teichert, Dr, Bejlin, Dr. Datner, Karasik, Szacman 
      and the Friedel manuscripts, the Macholl manuscript of October 25, 1949 
      (Documentation Volume VI, No. 71), and the calender of events in the concentration 
      camp Auschwitz as contained in the publication Hefte von Auschwitz, Nos. 
      3 and 4 (Doc. Vol . I , No. 38a) , November/December 1942 and January/February 
      1943 (cf. below pp. 128 ff.), along with the prisoner personal data sheets 
      pertaining to a number of Jewish prisoners in Auschwitz (Doc. Vol. I, No. 
      39a-h) and testimony by the witnesses Dr. Danuta Czech, Regina Gercek, Moses 
      Gercek, Laka and Altschuld. <br>
      <br>
      Dr. Altenloh's contention that he was unaware the concentration was a preparatory 
      measure for the later transport of Jews has been refuted. His subordinate 
      Errelis was aware of this fact, the Wehrmacht had been informed about this 
      (Dr. Teichert), and all Subdistrict Commissioners (Kommissare) involved 
      with the concentration operations derived their knowledge from the Gestapo 
      in Bialystok, under whose orders and direction they were acting in this 
      instance. They were told that the purpose of these measures was to deport 
      all Jews from Bialystok District. Moreover, the conditions in the assembly 
      camp Kelbasin excluded, right from the start, any possibility of quartering 
      persons there over the winter months. <br>
      <br>
      Various testimony has indicated that Jews were also concentrated at assembly 
      points in or near Augustowo/Grajewo, Sokolka (though Altenloh claims he 
      no longer has any recollection of this), the camp Centipolk and in Pruzana. 
      The defendant Altenloh contends he heard about the latter two for the first 
      time in the course of the present trial proceedings. Data pertaining to 
      Augustowo and the Centipolk camp are contained in the Friedel manuscript 
      (Doc. Vol. VI, No. 70). The Centipolk camp is also mentioned in this connection 
      in testimony presented by the accused Dibus and the witnesses Dr. Bejlin, 
      Dr. Datner, Karasik and Szacman. The witness Tubenthal has given testimony 
      regarding Pruzana. The above-mentioned Hefte von Auschwitz list Augustowo, 
      Sokolka and Pruzana as points of departure for deportation transports of 
      Jews to Auschwitz. <br>
      <br>
      Knowledge of the court about the train transports to Auschwitz is based 
      on the chronicle of events contained in these Hefte. These chronicles in 
      calendar form constitute reliable evidential basis for proof (see Sec. 7 
      below). The Polish historian Dr. Danuta Czech, staff researcher in the Auschwitz 
      Museum, compiled the transport lists in these calendrical chronicles strictly 
      on the basis of documents of the camp command found in Auschwitz. For all 
      train transports mentioned, there are lists with the name, birthdate and 
      number of each prisoner. It was therefore possible to infer the area of 
      origin of a given transport from the places of birth as listed for the prisoners 
      on the given train. In addition, prisoner personal data sheets exist for 
      a portion of the transports, such as for all trains to Auschwitz from the 
      district which have to date been definitely identified (see the selection 
      in Doc. Vol. I, No. 39 ff.). These data sheets even made it possible to 
      differentiate between Ghetto 2 and Kelbasin for transports from the Grodno 
      area in 1942. Although these transport lists may not be complete, the data 
      they contain are correct. <br>
      <br>
      The copy of the Hefte von Auschwitz in the possession of the court was checked 
      by the witness against the Polish original edition. The absolute reliability 
      of the work and testimony of the witness Czech has been repeatedly confirmed 
      during these proceedings by the fact that the Auschwitz prisoner-numbers 
      tattooed on the arms of several of the Jewish witnesses can be found precisely 
      in the lists for those transports with which the witnesses testify they 
      were sent to Auschwitz. <br>
      <br>
      There are only minor discrepancies in the data, since the lists usually 
      indicate the date of arrival of a specific transport in Auschwitz, while 
      the witnesses generally, if at all, are able to indicate only the departure 
      date, and nothing definite was determinable in most cases regarding the 
      length of travel time for a specific transport. In the instance of Zambrow, 
      for example, the witness Mrs. Gerzek, Auschwitz No. 29.507, claims she recalls 
      the arrival date of January 18, 1943, and this is confirmed by the list. 
      In regard to Pruzana, the witness Gercek, Auschwitz No. 97.939, stated that 
      this was the first transport from Pruzana to Auschwitz - this is confirmed 
      by the list. The witnesses Laka (Auschwitz No. 99.383) and Altschuld (Auschwitz 
      No. 99.222) stated correctly that they were on the final transport to Auschwitz 
      from Pruzana (see Doc. Vol. 1, No. 39n and 40a). <br>
      <br>
      Spot checks of the railroad documents available to the court, such as that 
      pertaining to the composition of the train transport of January 15/16, 1943, 
      or documents on the Pruzana/Oranczyce transports, likewise confirm the reliability 
      of the Auschwitz chronicle of events contained in the Hefte. <br>
      <br>
      This selection of the numerous confirmations should suffice. Moreover, it 
      is important to note that the reliability of the Auschwitz transport lists 
      was not challenged by those involved in these proceedings. <br>
      <br>
      Data on the liquidation of Centipolk camp are based principally on testimony 
      given by the witnesses Karasik and Dr. Datner, as well as the defendant 
      Dibus. The Hefte von Auschwitz, which remain silent about transports from 
      Bialystok other than those of the partial liquidation undertaken in February 
      1943, also provide us with an indication that Centipolk was not evacuated 
      to Auschwitz. Despite the extensive testimony presented, there have been 
      no indications - and it can thus be safely excluded - that there were any 
      other Jews (aside from those who had gone into hiding or the underground) 
      in Bialystok District at the beginning of February 1943 except for the residents 
      of the ghetto in Bialystok city and the remaining reduced ghetto in Grodno.

      <a name="transport2"></a> <b>4. Transports to the Death Camps in January 
      1943</b> <br>
      <br>
      The transport of Jews from Bialystok District was carried out according 
      to plan and with greater intensity during January 1943. The SS leadership 
      regarded the district thereafter as "judenrein" in accordance with Nazi 
      parlance, aside from the exceptions mentioned. From the numerous deportations 
      during this period, the prosecution chose to-include the transports from 
      Zambrow/Lomza (Dr. Altenloh) and Grodno (Altenloh and Errelis) in the charge 
      sheet. The liquidation of Pruzana (Dr. Altenloh) was likewise included among 
      the charges as a result of the supplementary suit filed by the head of the 
      Section for National Socialist Mass Crimes, State of North Rhine-Westfalia 
      in the office of the Senior State Prosecutor in Dortmund dated October 31, 
      1966, No. 45 Js 5/66. That charge was ruled on and allowed by the Third 
      Penal Chamber of the District Court in Hagen, November 30, 1966, and included 
      as part of the present proceedings (decison of January 4, 1967). <br>
      <br>
      The Third Penal Chamber, District Court, Hagen, at the request of the state 
      prosecutor, declared Dr. Altenloh not subject to prosecution for deportations 
      from Sokolka, Wolkowysk and Centipolk (decision of November 30, 1966). It 
      remains an open question whether - and if so, to what extent and under what 
      presuppositions - it might be possible to include these acts within the 
      charges dealt with by this trial. A conviction of the accused in regard 
      to the entire complex of liquidations implemented in the district in the 
      month of January 1943 is not possible. It is true that Dr. Altenloh has 
      admitted being involved in the deportations from Zambrow/Lomza and Grodno, 
      and he has been convicted of participation in the liquidation of Grodno. 
      Moreover, the accused Errelis has admitted his part in the deportations 
      from Ghetto 1 in Grodno. However, both defendants have denied any knowledge 
      of the criminal intent of the transports they were ordered to carry out; 
      that contention has not been refuted for the time period in question here. 
      <br>

      <a name="deport1"></a> <b>5. Deportations from Grodno, January 18, 1943</b> 
      <br>
      <br>
      The operation in Grodno began on January 18, 1943, immediately after the 
      liquidation of the army barracks in Zambrow. The large Ghetto 1 was still 
      in existence there at that time. It was liquidated and its residents sent 
      to Auschwitz, except for a small number of several thousand Jews. There 
      is definite knowledge about a total of five transports on subsequent days 
      from Grodno; these arrived in Auschwitz from January 20 to 24, 1943. The 
      Jews call this partial liquidation of Ghetto 1 in Grodno >Operation 10,000<. 
      This name is quite apt and can give some indication of the magnitude of 
      the operation. Exact figures cannot be determined. One can assume an absolute 
      minimum of 7,500 deported Jews. Errelis was responsible, in his capacity 
      as head of the post, for local organization and implementation of the transport. 
      Errelis had received the order from Dr. Altenloh. The former Detective Sergeant 
      Wiese played a primary role in the liquidation action. <br>
      <br>
      The horrifying details of the implementation of this liquidation operation 
      are significant for - and characteristic of - the personality and state 
      of knowledge of the defendant Errelis. Correspondingly, these have been 
      described in detail and evaluated in the presentation of his legal responsibility. 
      At this juncture, only one general point should be underscored: the subordinates 
      of Errelis shot and killed at least 100 persons without sufficient reason 
      during this liquidation operation. <br>
      <br>
      <b>Basis for Proof</b> <br>
      <br>
      Findings in the first section are based on the calendar of events in Auschwitz 
      camp (Hefte von Auschwitz 4. Doc. Vol. I, 38a), as well as testimony presented 
      by the defendants Altenloh and Errelis. <br>

      <br>
      This liquidation - the so-called >Operation 10,000< - was part of the evacuation 
      of the entire district, final destination Auschwitz. Both Altenloh and Errelis 
      admit their part in these operations. Errelis gave credible testimony that 
      he was frequently in the ghetto and supervised the composition of each individual 
      transport. However, he denies having had any knowledge of the destructive 
      intent of the order. As in the case of Altenloh, the court is not convinced 
      that it can be proven beyond doubt that Errelis was aware of this in January 
      1943. That is evident from the following findings and considerations regarding 
      the final liquidation of Grodno in February 1943. <br>
      <br>
      <b>B. The Final Liquidation and Removal, February 1943</b> <br>
      <br>
      On February 13, 1943, immediately after the partial liquidation of the ghetto 
      in Bialystok, the final liquidation of the remainder of Ghetto 1 in Grodno 
      commenced. Altenloh had received the liquidation order along with transport 
      documents from the RSHA together with the order for evacuating Bialystok 
      city. He passed this on immediately to Errelis. Treblinka was listed as 
      final destination. Errelis carried out the liquidation together with his 
      subordinates. He himself was frequently inside the ghetto, and supervised 
      the composition and departure of each transport. The principal person responsible 
      for implementation of the deportations in Ghetto 1 was Detective Sergeant 
      Wiese, especially in operations relating to rounding up of Jews. The assembly 
      point was the main synagogue. During >Operation 10,000<, Gestapo officials 
      killed at least 100 Jews - men, women and children without reason; at least 
      50 Jews were killed in this way in February. At least three transports were 
      sent to Treblinka on February 13, 14 and 16, 1943. Ghetto 1, and thus Grodno 
      town, was cleared of Jews as a result, except for a remaining 1,000 artisans. 
      The Jewish craftsmen had proved themselves to be excellent workers in duties 
      for the Gestapo, and were later transferred on March 12, 1943 to the ghetto 
      in Bialystok city. With these three train transports, a total of at least 
      3,500 Jews were sent to their death in Treblinka. <br>
      <br>
      Altenloh and Errelis were cognizant of all this. They knew the intended 
      destination of the transports, the criminal intent of the order, the certain 
      destruction awaiting all deported Jews in Treblinka. Errelis was also familiar 
      with the type and extent of the excessive killings which took place during 
      these operations. Both defendants were aware of the gross criminal nature 
      of the deportations. It was also clear to them that racist reasons could 
      never justify such acts. <br>
      <br>
      <b>The Evidence and its Evaluation</b> <br>
      <br>
      These findings are based - aside from the statements by the defendants Altenloh 
      and Errelis, insofar as these were credible - on findings and considerations 
      in earlier sections of the proceedings, the expert testimony of the historian 
      Dr. Scheffler, the Hefte von Auschwitz already mentioned, testimony by the 
      witness Dr. Danuta Czech, Zabecki, Gnichwitz and Nowik, as well in particular 
      on evidence presented in the following individual descriptions. <br>
      <br>
      The accused Altenloh and Errelis admit their participation to the extent 
      established. They did not make any statement regarding the number of transports 
      and the total number of deported Jews. <br>
      <br>
      There were at least three transport trains. One train, No. Pj 163, left 
      Grodno for Treblinka on February 14. This can be derived from the schedule 
      No. 552 of the General Direction, Eastern Railway in Cracow of February 
      1, 1943. This train had been planned for a long time, since it is included 
      in the list of special trains agreed on January 15, 1943 in Berlin by the 
      General Direction, Eastern Railway (Jan. 16, 1943, Doc. Vol. IV-7, 117 ff.). 
      The train bears the serial routing number 122. An additional train, Pj 165, 
      left Grodno for Treblinka on February 16, 1943. This is indicated by two 
      railway telegrams (Doc. Vol. II-5, 11 f.). After this, the train Pj 163 
      was redirected back to Grodno as an empty train, LP Pj 164, and was not 
      sent to Ostrolenka, as originally planned (cf. list in Doc. Vol. V-7, 117 
      ff. , 121 ff.). On February 16, 1943, that same train, now designated Pj 
      165, brought a further transport of Jews to Treblinka. Only after this was 
      it sent on as an empty train, designated LP Pj 166, to Ostrolenka. <br>
      <br>
      Moreover, the court is convinced that a transport train departed Grodno 
      for Treblinka already on February 13, 1943. This can be ascertained from 
      the following: according to the schedule No. 552 of February 1, 1943, the 
      special trains agreed upon on January 15, 1943 in Berlin and the associated 
      rerouting plan for the freight trains to be used in multiple fashion, Pj 
      135 was scheduled to depart Bialystok for Treblinka as a fully loaded train 
      on February 13, 1943. However, this did not occur. The partial liquidation 
      in Bialystok had been concluded already on February 12, 1943, one day earlier 
      than originally planned. The court considers it impossible that a train 
      already made available by the Reichsbahn was not utilized by SS officials 
      for deportation of Jews. The court believes that this train is indeed identical 
      with Pj 135, which was scheduled to depart Bialystok for Treblinka, but 
      was rerouted to Grodno, and then departed Grodno with a full load of deportees 
      for Treblinka on February 13. <br>
      <br>
      This is a reasonable conclusion, since the date of February 13 was mentioned 
      in contemporary - and thus particularly reliable - statements as the day 
      on which liquidation operations in Grodno commenced. The diary of Tenenbaum-Tamaroff 
      (Doc. Vol. V, No. 7) contains the following entry for February 14, 1943, 
      p. 34: a certain person by the name of Chaim from Grodno said that they 
      had started there with the final liquidation of the Jews. Barrasch stated 
      that four members of the Judenrat, a few craft artisans and the factories 
      of the Grodno ghetto were to be transferred to Bialystok, and that several 
      machines had already arrived. If the dating for this entry is accurate, 
      i.e., February 14, it can be assumed that the liquidation in Grodno had 
      begun already before February 14, i.e., on the 13th at the latest. The court 
      is satisfied that the dating in the diary is accurate. <br>
      <br>
      This was a relatively quiet period in Bialystok. Tenenbaum-Tamaroff had 
      time to write in his diary. Another entry tends to support the reliability 
      of these remarks on the Grodno liquidation: for February 17 (p. 37), the 
      diary notes that 15 freight cars containing Jews had passed Bialystok travelling 
      in the direction of Malkinia (i.e. Treblinka). This entry is confirmed by 
      the railway telegrams, according to which Pj 165 left Grodno on February 
      16 for Treblinka, i.e., via Bialystok. It is also confirmed by the freight 
      lading slip of Pj 129, which designates trains with the routing series no. 
      122 - and thus Pj 165 as well - as short-distance trains. <br>
      <br>
      At least 3,500 persons were deported during these operations. <br>
      <br>
      The Grodno Jews recall the February liquidation as the so-called >Operation 
      5,000<. That designation indicates that they believe this final liquidation 
      involved the deportation of some 5,000 persons to the death camp. The defendants 
      Altenloh and Errelis do not dispute the figure. It also is in agreement 
      with the plans as can be derived from the composition of the trains and 
      the routing plan, both put together by the General Direction, Eastern Railway 
      in Berlin. According to this, trains with the routing serial no. 122 transported 
      a total of 2,000 persons each. Trains with serial no. 122 included Pj 163 
      and Pj 165, which departed Grodno for Treblinka on February 14 and 16 respectively. 
      Since they had the same routing number, they consisted of the same freight 
      cars. <br>
      <br>
      However, the court has doubts as to whether a total of 4,000 individuals 
      were in fact transported by these two trains. A lading slip from one of 
      the freight cars of Pj 129 has accidentally been preserved (Vol. B II-5, 
      p. 9). Pj 129 likewise had the serial routing no. 122. Thus, the same freight 
      cars were on trains Pj 163 and Pj 165, a total of 13 cars. Even if one proceeds 
      on the assumption that each car contained 80 persons, this gives a total 
      of just over 1,000 people transported by each train. The court has no reason 
      to doubt that an average of at least 80 persons per freight car were transported. 
      According to all testimony presented (cf. statements by the witnesses Frelichmann 
      for the transports from Grodno 1942, Regina Gercek for Zambrow/Lomza, Steinberg 
      for >Operation 10,000< in Grodno /Auschwitz prisoner no. 92 802, arrival 
      in Auschwitz on January 22, 1943, cf. Hefte von Auschwitz, ibid./ and Sol 
      Gelchinsky, Isaak Gielczynski for the August liquidation in Bialystok; there 
      are no known survivors of the February transports from Grodno), so many 
      Jews were packed into the freight cars that there was no room left to sit. 
      If one bears in mind that during World War II, a total of 40 men per freight 
      car was common practice in transporting infantry units, and that these 40 
      men had enough room to sit and even to stretch out, then a load of 80 persons, 
      densely packed and standing, seems a reasonable figure to assume. <br>
      <br>
      There is no documentation on the number of cars in the train of February 
      13, 1943. According to the schedule, which lists the train as Pj 135 from 
      Bialystok to Treblinka, it should be recalled that this train was rerouted 
      to Grodno rather than Bialystok, and then on to Treblinka from Grodno; its 
      routing serial no. is 121. The schedule indicates the train had a planned 
      load of 2,000 persons. It is the opinion of the court that the number of 
      persons in fact transported was at least of this magnitude. In a diary entry 
      for February 19, 1943, Tenenbaum-Tamaroff notes reports on Grodno from "L" 
      and "Sch": they said that on Saturday, February 13, a total even of 2,500 
      Jews were deported from Grodno. In order to be on the safe side, however, 
      the court decided, to the benefit of the accused, that the three trains 
      had transported no more than a total of at least 3,500 individuals to Treblinka 
      from Grodno during the February liquidation operation. <br>
      <br>
      Errelis, as local head of operations, had an exact picture of the extent 
      of the deportations. It was his responsibility to report on the operation 
      to his superior KdS. Dr. Altenloh knew how many Jews were still left in 
      Grodno. Not only the orders to Grodno passed through his hands, but also 
      the train documents with scheduling changes as well. Those changes were 
      probably even initiated by Bialystok with the consent of Grodno officials, 
      depending on local requirements. The figure of 3,500 deported Jews is such 
      a low estimate that one thing remains certain: Altenloh was undoubtedly 
      aware of the magnitude of the action (at least) in respect to deportation 
      operations from Grodno in February 1943. <br>
      <br>
      However, Altenloh and Errelis deny they knew that the final destination 
      was Treblinka, and that the intent of the order was the extermination of 
      the Jews. They claim they believed the purported official motivation: relocation 
      of Jews for conscripted labor. Moreover, Errelis contends that only one 
      Jew died by violence during the entire period of his command in Grodno, 
      namely Dr. Brawer, and that his death had been due to an error committed 
      by a police officer. <br>
      <br>
      That contention has been disproven. In the case of Altenloh, this is clear 
      from findings and considerations in earlier sections of the final verdict. 
      Errelis was also aware, at the latest when he received the order to proceed 
      with the final liquidation of Ghetto 1, that the deported Jews were being 
      sent to their death. However, the findings based on the hearing of testimony 
      below are insufficient to prove that he was already aware of this while 
      supervising >Operation 10,000<, even though there is a strong suspicion 
      of his guilt in this connection. <br>
      <br>
      In order to substantiate his actual awareness of these facts, it is initially 
      necessary to recall the situation as it existed in Grodno during the period 
      from November 1942 to February 1943. After Jews throughout the district 
      were gathered together and concentrated in a small number of localities 
      on November 2, 1942, the responsibility of the Gestapo for the ghettos in 
      Grodno was also expanded. Up until that time, guarding of the ghettos had 
      been the responsibility of the local police, and essential supplies to the 
      ghetto had been handled by the local civil administration. <br>
      <br>
      From this point onward, the Gestapo also took over these duties. The Jewish 
      inhabitants living in the vicinity of Grodno were gathered together in the 
      camp Kelbasin located near Grodno. This camp had served the Russian and, 
      at a later date, the Polish army as a base camp during manoeuvers. Trenches 
      big enough for a company of men had been dug. These trenches were fitted 
      on the inside with wood and covered by a wooden roof. After the Grodno area 
      was captured by the Germans, Russian POWs had been interned in this camp. 
      <br>
      <br>
      The camp had since been evacuated and placed at the disposal of the Gestapo 
      for concentrating Jews from the Grodno area. There were at least 8,000 Jews 
      in the Kelbasin camp. The witness Shulkes testified to the court that some 
      22,000 Jews had been quartered there. There were a total of approximately 
      20,000 to 25,000 Jews in Ghettos 1 and 2; Ghetto I was much more heavily 
      populated than Ghetto 2. Living conditions in the Grodno ghettos had been 
      poor since their establishment. Ghetto 1 was somewhat more privileged, since 
      it contained the so-called "useful" Jews. In contrast to Bialystok, however, 
      there was no armaments industry of any importance in the Grodno ghettos. 
      As far as is known, the only war industry factory was a plant for felt boots 
      in Ghetto 1. In addition, there were several other factories, but they were 
      not working for the German Wehrmacht. <br>
      <br>
      The Gestapo outpost in Grodno was not divided into departments. Formally, 
      it was under the direct command of the head of Dept. IV (Gestapo) in Bialystok. 
      It carried out all the tasks of the Gestapo. Errelis, as head of the post, 
      was responsible for their implementation. Where necessary, he made use of 
      the 10-12 officers under his authority. Thus, Errelis was familiar with 
      all events concerning his post. Errelis' immediate subordinate in rank was 
      Detective Staff Sergeant Schott, who is no longer living. <br>
      <br>
      Although the post was not structured into separate sections, Errelis had 
      designated several staff who had special responsibility for Jews. Thus, 
      the Detective Sergeant Wiese, with his corresponding SS rank, was responsible 
      for Ghetto 1. A certain Streblow, since deceased, was responsible for Ghetto 
      2. Responsible for Kelbasin were ei ther Best or another of f i ci al , 
      Rinzer, likewise dead, who was assigned as translator. These three - Wiese, 
      Streblow and Rinzer conducted a reign of terror in the two ghettos and the 
      Kelbasin camp. <br>
      <br>
      A short time after the concentration on November 2, 1942, there were small 
      numbers of deportations of Jews from Ghetto 2 in Grodno and the Kelbasin 
      camp to Auschwitz. During these transports, 1,000 Jews regarded as productive 
      workers were taken aside in Ghetto 2 before deportation and transferred 
      to Ghetto 1. Parallel with this, some 1,000 Jews deemed unable or unwilling 
      to work were transferred from Ghetto 1 to Kelbasin, and from there were 
      subsequently deported to Auschwitz. Only a few were successful, most probably 
      by bribery, in gaining transfer from Kelbasin back to Ghetto 1. At the end 
      of December 1942, the entire Ghetto 2 and the Kelbasin camp were completely 
      liquidated, except for a small remainder in Kelbasin. The few Jews remaining 
      in Kelbasin were transferred back to Ghetto 1 due to the extreme cold. <br>
      <br>
      From January 18-22, 1943, during >Operation 10,000<, a total of at least 
      7,500 Jews - men, women and children - were deported from Ghetto 1 in five 
      trains to Auschwitz, where most of them were murdered. The aim of >Operation 
      5,000<, which began on February 13, 1943, was the total and complete liquidation 
      of the ghetto. On March 12, 1943, the Jews "useful" to the Gestapo, the 
      last Jews still remaining in Grodno, were transferred to Bialystok. <br>
      <br>
      Beginning in November 1942, the subordinates of Errelis tortured or shot 
      numerous Jews in Grodno arbitrarily, without adequate reason. Such acts 
      were perpetrated in particular during liquidations in January and February 
      1943. <br>
