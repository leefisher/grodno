				<h3>BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS - 2</h3></center><br><br><br>
<font size="+1">Antisemitism and Pogroms</font><br><br>
Antisemitism, an ancient scourge in Poland, was sharply aggravated in
the inter-war period as alienation between Jews and Poles intensified.
The antisemitic atmosphere was most acutely felt in spheres in which
Jews came into direct contact with Poles, such as in Polish schools or on
the sports field. Verbal abuse of Jewish children in Polish schools was
commonplace. Polish high-school students, influenced by the Endeks,
forced their Jewish comrades to stand during lessons; the teachers, even
those who were not antisemites, were usually afraid to intervene. Jewish
children often fell victim to antisemitic incidents on their way to or from
school. Sundays were notoriously violent. On the way to the soccer
stadium, Jews were set upon and beaten, and a victory by the Jewish
side was sufficient reason for renewed attacks. Jews were also assaulted
on the street and in public parks.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The recurring violence led Jewish youngsters to organize defense
groups. The Brit ha-Hayal (“Soldier’s Alliance”) in Grodno, consisting
of strong young men, often came to the defense of individual Jews and
even of the entire Jewish quarter.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No pogroms were perpetrated as long as Josef Pilsudski was in power.
Although Pilsudski did not refer publicly to the Jewish question, he
never excluded the Jews from the category of citizens possessing full
and equal rights in the state. His personality was the major factor in the
preservation of order in Poland. However, after his death, in May 1935,
and as a result of economic stagnation and the rising strength of
National Socialism in Germany, the influence of the Endecja party grew
and antisemitism gathered new momentum in Poland. In the years
before the outbreak of World War II, a wave of anti-Jewish pogroms
washed across the entire country. Grodno was not spared.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the night of June 6, 1935, in the course of a fight that broke out in
a dance hall, a Jewish youngster stabbed his Christian adversary, who
died on the way to the hospital. The deceased was a former sailor, and
the rumor was circulated that a Jew had murdered a Polish soldier.
When the police arrested the knife-wielding Jew, the episode seemed to
have ended. But the next day anti-Jewish riots erupted after the funeral.
About 1,000 people attended the last rites, among them many Endeks
and members of the underworld who demanded vengeance. A large
mob armed with iron bars, knives, and clubs stormed out of the
cemetery and made its way to the city center. Within half an hour
lawless gangs were rampaging across Grodno and attacking every Jew
they encountered. As it happened, it was the Shavuot festival and many
Jews were out walking and fell prey to the mob. The rioters smashed
shop-windows in the commercial district, looted widely, and left a trail
of destruction. Some rioters entered the Jewish quarter and smashed
doors and windows with rocks and bars. They spared only the Shulhoif
and the Troickie quarter, where physically imposing Jews – mainly
butchers, porters, and wagoners – lived.<br><br>

<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Jews organized quickly. Community leaders and representatives
of Jewish organizations met at Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir headquarters and
chose a self-defense committee consisting of Aharon Yizersky, Aharon
Rubinczik, and Shmuel Diamant. The communists mobilized 200
people, ten of them bearing firearms. Teenagers were given the job of
sitting by phones so as to coordinate communications and intelligence.
A number of Poles, mostly friends or acquaintances of Jews, offered
their help. Throughout the entire episode the police were flagrantly
absent, claiming afterward that they had been occupied elsewhere.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The local authorities tried to suppress the event, but the Jews decided
to go to court. In the course of the trial, the authorities blamed the Jews,
and the incident ended with brief suspended sentences for the
defendants; their leader was sentenced to one year in prison, was
released on bail, and later pardoned.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A letter from the Va’ad ha-Kehillah to the district governor described
the casualties and the damage inflicted during the riots of June 7-8,
1935, in Grodno: Gedaliah Becher and Yisrael Berzowski were killed;
Shlomo Pozniak was hospitalized and his family was threatened with
eviction from their apartment because they could not pay the hospital
bill; Leib Buchinsky was hospitalized in Warsaw awaiting surgery and
was in danger of losing his hand; all told, forty to fifty Jews were injured,
and about 300 suffered property damage or lost their jobs. Damage was
estimated at 30,000 zloty, but the Va’ad asked for only 5,000 zloty in
compensation, and, after a lengthy delay the district authorities
approved 1,000 zloty, to be divided among the injured families.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Apart from the two victims mentioned above, a third Jew was killed
seventeen days after the pogrom while passing in the street.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This was not the last violent eruption of antisemitism in Grodno.
In the remaining four years before the war there were increasing acts of
hooliganism and violence motivated by antisemitism.<br><br>
<b>The Jewish Reaction</b><br><br>
Grodno’s Jews did not accept the economic boycott passively and
put up a relentless struggle for their right to work and earn a living. In
the 1930s, as economic antisemitism intensified, the Jewish community
also held protest rallies and demonstrations. On May 24, 1937, for
example, they closed their shops and demonstrated for their right to live
and work in peace. A gathering of Jewish small merchants from the
entire region, held in Bialystok in August 1938, called on the authorities
to put an end to the activity of the endeks who were generating hatred
among the populace. A Jewish delegation from Grodno met with the
official in charge of security to urge that the peace and security of the
city’s inhabitants be preserved, particularly in the commercial sphere.
On October 20, 1937, the entire Jewish community demonstrated
against the “ghetto benches” that had been installed in the country’s
universities and schools of higher education. However, none of the
appeals – to the authorities or to the public – had any effect, and the
situation continued to deteriorate.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
At the same time Jewish communities and institutions organized for
mutual assistance, establishing cooperatives, introducing direct-aid
methods, making available professional training, and so forth. In
Grodno the Va’ad ha-Kehillah was forced to cut its staff’s salaries so that
it could offer both one-time grants and monthly relief to the
unemployed, who received no government aid. An increasing number
of community members began turning to the charitable organizations;
“poverty cards,” which exempted their holders from tax payments,
were introduced.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Entrepreneurs tried their hand in new branches of commerce. For
example, wagon owners from Sopockin, near Grodno, who used to
make a living by hauling goods to and from the city, got together and
bought a truck, and then a bus, and established a company that
transported both people and goods between the two destinations.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many Jews, particularly the young, opted for emigration. Some
joined <i>hakhsharah</i> (pioneer-training) groups and reached Eretz Israel
legally; others drew on the help of relatives in the United States and
managed to emigrate despite the stringent immigration laws. Most of
the other developed countries also imposed virtually insurmountable
immigration barriers. Although, at the end of the 1930s, agreements
were reached with Latin American states to take in Polish emigrants,
shopkeepers and lessees were not welcome, nor were Jews in general.
Among the countries in which Jews found refuge were Canada,
Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, and Cuba. The majority,
however, and particularly those with families, remained in Poland. The
complex logistical problems and enormous costs involved in the
emigration of an entire family virtually ruled out this option.<br><br>
<b>Community Life and Institutions</b><br><br>
<i>Official Status and Organization.</i> The Treaty of National Minorities,
which was signed between Poland and the Allies at Versailles on June
28, 1919, assured the minorities of their physical safety, freedom of
religion, the right to maintain educational, welfare, and charitable
institutions, and to educate their children in their national language.
The Treaty of Riga (March 18, 1921) also guaranteed the rights of the
minorities in Poland. Under Article 7, Poland was committed to ensure
the minorities the freedom to cultivate their culture, religion, and
language. In practice, however, the Polish government deprived the
Jews of these rights and adopted a discriminatory policy against them
in most areas. In the first years of the independent Polish state, the
Kehillah and its institutions continued to function almost as before –
under government supervision and under pressure to confine their
activity to religious activities. However, as the Kehillah was not
permitted to levy mandatory taxes, it had to finance its budget
independently, primarily by means of the services it rendered. Thus the
public had to pay for the upkeep of the Jewish religious institutions. This
was the situation in most of Poland (in the former Congress Poland the
Dozor Boznicy [“Synagogue Council,” which resembled the French
consistory introduced by Napoleon I] remained in effect). Only in 1927
was a new constitution approved for the Jewish communities in Poland
in which the right to levy statutory taxes was included.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Grodno Community Council was headed by the city’s most
affluent Jews. The first Community Council, which served from 1918
to 1921, consisted of twenty members, of whom ten were members of
the executive (the Va’ad), representing the Bund, the Zionist Poalei
Zion and Ze’irei Zion, and the haredim (ultra-Orthodox). The executive,
which met in closed session, conducted its business in Yiddish, but
recorded the minutes in the official language of the state, as the
government authorities demanded.<br><br>

</center>
<i>Activities and Budget.</i> According to the executive’s annual budget report
for 1930, the main expenditures were: taxes to the authorities, rent for
the Kehillah’s premises, funding of relief and social-welfare institutions
(hospitals, orphanages), salaries to teachers and the Kehillah staff, and
expenses for religious needs and administration. The main sources of
income – payment for ritual slaughter and for burial, and tuition fees
paid by some pupils – were supplemented by assistance from TOZ (the
Jewish Health Care Organization) and a subsidy from the municipality.
Nevertheless, a certain deficit remained. The Kehillah also had a
Control Committee that examined the finances and the books, the
allocation of subsidies, and the operation of all the Council’s
departments and institutions: the slaughter house, bath house, burial
society (which to some degree was financially self-sufficient), library,
and numerous other social-welfare and cultural institutions that were
the distinguishing features of the Kehillah organization.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Among the relief and social-welfare institutions in Grodno were
benevolent funds that provided interest-free loans to small shopkeepers
and artisans who were in financial need. Rather than interest, the
recipients committed themselves to fixed monthly payments in order to
cover the fund’s expenses. The fund’s capital came from three sources:
stocks, aid from the United States, and assistance from the national
organization of benevolent funds in Poland.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Jewish medical system in Poland during the inter-war period did
not cover everyone. Workers in large enterprises, teachers, and public
servants had medical insurance and were treated free of charge.
However, large sections of the public were not entitled to any health
services, and private medicine flourished. The state health authorities
had virtually nothing to do with public health and sanitation and, other
than inoculating the population against smallpox, did nothing to curb
infectious diseases and epidemics. “Linat Zedek” was a Jewish
association of volunteers who sat with the sick at night so that family
members could rest; they also loaned medical equipment to ill persons
who could not afford the purchase price, provided the indigent with
medical attention, medicines, and even financial aid, and, if necessary,
financed medical treatment in hospitals in Grodno or Bialystok. The
association’s funds were raised from the proceeds from stage
performances and “film days.”
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were many other relief and charitable institutions and
associations in the community, including an old-age home, an
orphanage, the rescue committee (Va’ad ha-Hazalah), the yeshivah’s
kitchen, lodgings for transients, the Hekdesh (accommodations for the
poor and the sick), Kimha de-Piskha (a campaign to supply the poor with
matzah for Passover), Hakhnasat Kallah (dowries for poor brides), and
Lehem Ani’im (bread for the poor). There was also a legal bureau in
which Jewish lawyers, on a rotating basis, offered free legal advice. TOZ
arranged medical treatment and monitoring for pregnant, post-natal,
and nursing women; organized compulsory medical checkups in the
schools; and ran summer camps for children.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, not everything in the Kehillah was on a volunteer basis. The
Community Council was entitled to request payment for various
services, such as ritual slaughter, marriages, circumcisions, and burials.
Taxes, generally in the form of a commitment to make a monthly
contribution, were imposed on the affluent in order to cover the cost of
the various staffs and the maintenance of institutions. Additional
sources of income were financial aid from former residents who had
settled in the United States and from the Swiss branch of the Joint
Distribution Committee.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Grodno Va’ad ha-Kehillah occasionally offered welfare aid to
Jews outside the city as well. For example, the Community Council was
one of the first to respond to the call that was issued on June 6, 1922, to
provide generous assistance to starving Jews in Russia and the Ukraine.
Grodno’s Jews also came to the aid of Iwia Jews after the pogrom of
1929, and assisted the Jews of Lunna in 1931. In 1927, following an
earthquake in Palestine, there was a call in Grodno to establish a
committee in order to coordinate aid for the casualties. A leaflet urged
all the worshippers at the Beit ha-Midrash and the representatives of
Jewish organizations and societies to meet in the office of the Va’ad
ha-Kehillah in order to launch the aid operation.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Involvement of a different kind was manifested in the form of concern
for Germany’s Jews. On May 1, 1933, the Kehillah sent the League of
Nations a petition protesting the persecution of the Jews in Germany,
and, in late 1938, when Jewish citizens of Poland were deported from
Germany to Zbac szyn (Zbonshin) on the Polish border, the community ´
collected clothing and food for the refugees. Some of them actually
reached Grodno (including former residents of the city) and were
helped to settle there by the Jewish community.<br><br>
