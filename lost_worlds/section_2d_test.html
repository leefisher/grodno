				<h3>BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS - 4</h3></center><br><br><br>
<i>Cultural Life.</i> Jewish Grodno was a beehive of cultural activity. The city
was a magnet for theater companies, actors, singers, famous cantors,
renowned choirs, intellectuals, and public figures from Poland and
elsewhere. Visitors included Ze’ev Jabotinsky, Shaul Tchernichowsky,
and Chaim Nahman Bialik, who was surprised to hear the local children
speaking Hebrew. The visitors met with the townspeople in the Great
Synagogue or in one of the many batei midrash.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A large number of dramatic groups were active in the city, for the
most part in Yiddish. The Polish authorities, however, tried to
counteract this trend, levying heavy taxes on Yiddish performances,
making it difficult for Jewish theater groups to rent halls, and, in
particular, setting stringent conditions in order to obtain a permit for
Jewish productions. So as to circumvent this discrimination the Jews
founded the Yiddish Teater Gesellschaft theater society, which was
affiliated with the Va’ad ha-Kehillah and had considerable success in its
confrontations with the municipal authorities. An important
achievement was that the municipal theater was made available for
Jewish productions eight times a month free of charge.<br><br>

This intensive cultural and artistic activity was not confined only to the
city. Grodno troupes, led by the well-known actor and singer Michael
Trielling and the popular comedian Yitzhak Azarkh, frequently toured
the surrounding towns. Not every town could be reached by bus, and
the actors sometimes had to travel by horse-and-carriage; at times they
appeared in a barn or cowshed.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Particularly notable among the many Jewish choirs and orchestras in
Grodno were the choir of the Great Synagogue and the brass band of
the city’s firefighters, which was almost entirely Jewish. Orchestras were
also maintained by Tarbut institutions, sports associations, and Jewish
youth organizations, such as the string orchestra of the Dror-Freiheit
youth movement and the mandolin orchestra of the CISHO school.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The major figure in the city’s musical life was Reuven Vigderowitz –
choirmaster, teacher, and composer – who was also a famous
harmonica virtuoso. He conducted students’ choirs, including the
Tarbut choir, and adult choirs such as “Hashmona’i” (Hasmonean, the
name given to the Maccabee choir after it was shut down by the
authorities). In 1937–1938 Vigderowitz formed a popular choir of 120
men and women. This was a considerable accomplishment given the
deteriorating economic situation and the charged atmosphere created
by the surging antisemitism. The choir performed in the municipal
theater and in the surrounding area. Most of its members were workers
and Bund members (initially they refused to sing Bialik’s “After My
Death” in Hebrew, which was set to music by Vigderowitz, but finally
they yielded to their conductor’s importunings).

The city’s public library was large for that time, with 2,536 volumes in
Yiddish, 1,907 in Hebrew, and many in Russian. However, no new
books were purchased because of insufficient funds; in 1933/34, for
example, the library acquired only two new books, one in Yiddish and
one in Hebrew. Jewish organizations in the city also maintained
libraries, notably the Brenner Library of Poalei Zion.
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Various Yiddish daily papers and weeklies were published in Grodno,
providing the Jewish population with information about events in the
community, the municipality, and on job openings, as well as reporting
critically on the Va’ad ha-Kehillah and other Jewish institutions. Much
was written about harmful actions taken by the authorities and by the
non-Jewish population and about the struggle of the Jews to realize their
rights. In large part these were national papers in Yiddish, originating
in Warsaw and other cities, with only the front and back pages printed
locally. But Grodno also had its own papers. The daily <i>Grodner Moment</i>
began to appear on September 5, 1924, edited by David Berezowski,
and continued publication until the outbreak of World War II, except
between 1928 and 1931, when it was replaced by the <i>Unser Grodner
Ekspress.</i>
<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the 1930s, the <i>Grodner Kurrier</i> was published as an afternoon
edition of <i>Grodner Moment.</i> <i>Grodner Radio</i> and <i>Heintike Neies</i> (“Daily
News”), both of which appeared in Grodno in 1931, were published in
Warsaw and brought to Grodno, where local items were added, such as
announcements about meetings for the benefit of the unemployed,
information about the orphanage, and the like. <i>Grodner Leben</i> (“Grodno
Life”) was a nonparty daily edited by Shmuel Garbe and appeared from
1936 to 1939.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Notable among the Jewish weeklies were: <i>Unser Leben</i> (“Our Life”),
the first Zionist weekly in Grodno, which began publication in
1926-1927, and was edited by Yitzhak Solowieyczyk, with Zvi Bielko as
chief contributor; the <i>Bund’s Grodner Shtimme</i> (“Voice of Grodno”),
founded in 1927 – its first editor (until 1935) was Moshe Rubinstein –
appeared regularly until the start of the war, even though it constantly
incensed the authorities, who often tried members of its editorial board;
and <i>Unser Wort</i> (“Our Word”), the journal of the Working Eretz Israel
Movement, which began to appear in 1933, and was edited by A.
Palnitsky.<br><br><i>Sport.</i> Several Jewish sports clubs operated in Grodno, most notably
Maccabee (founded in 1919), which, thanks to its excellent reputation,
enjoyed the support of the city’s affluent population. The club ran a
good soccer team, and its track and field branch was also well
developed. However, for a time the Polish government prohibited its
operation. In 1924, the club operated secretly under other names, such
as “Hashmona’i,” but a year later resumed activity under its own name
and even added new sports, such as bicycling, boxing, skiing, and a
section for military training; in 1938, basketball was also added.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Ha-Koah (“Power”) association, founded by Poalei Zion-ZS, was
the first manifestation of the party’s sports movement in Poland,
preceding Hapoel. Ha-Koah ran teams in soccer, gymnastics, table
tennis, and chess. The many youngsters who were active in this club
were inculcated with the ideology of the Dror movement.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1928, the Bund established the Morgenstern (“Morning Star”)
sports club, which featured several gymnastics groups, a soccer team,
and a table tennis section. The club also published a bulletin called
Arbeter Sportler, which was circulated throughout Poland.
Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir also had its own sports organization, known as
Shomriyah. Here the emphasis was on gymnastics and volleyball.
Shomriyah members participated in an annual sports demonstration
held in the city.
