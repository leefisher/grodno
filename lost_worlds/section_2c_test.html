<i>Religion and Tradition.</i> Grodno was known as a “Jewish city” because of
its pervasive Jewish-traditional atmosphere. This had less to do with the
large proportion of Jews in the population than with the community’s
attitude toward religion and tradition. True, in the inter-war period
there was increasing secularization among Jews, and most strikingly
among the young; yet even secular homes continued to uphold the
basic elements of tradition. Parents of children attending Polish schools
saw to it that the youngsters received a Jewish education, either by
hiring private tutors or by sending the children to heder. The Jewish
atmosphere was also prevalent because of the many Jewish buildings
that dotted the streets. In 1931, there were in Grodno thirty-six
synagogues, houses of worship, or Hassidic kloizim. The many
minyanim – of wagoners, glaziers, tailors, carpenters, workers, furriers,
and so forth – continued to exist throughout the decade, despite the
worsening condition of Poland’s Jews. Grodno’s central synagogue
dated from ancient times, and around it were smaller houses of worship
that together constituted the Shulhoif, the hub of the city’s Jewish
religious life.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the final two decades of its existence, the Grodno Kehillah was the
site of the renowned Sha’arei Torah yeshivah. Founded during World
War I under the German occupation by and at the initiative of the
students themselves, the yeshivah was originally headed by Rabbi Alter
Shmuelevicz. His successor between 1920 and 1939, the famous scholar
Rabbi Shimon Shkop, raised the level of the institution and transformed
it into one of the finest yeshivot in Poland and beyond. Hundreds of
young men flocked to Sha’arei Torah from near and far. Rabbi Shkop’s
novellae on the Talmud are still studied in yeshivot throughout the world
today.<br><br>
<i>Education.</i> The Jewish educational system in Grodno consisted of a large
variety of elementary and high schools, both general and professional,
as well as hadarim and yeshivot. They were associated with a broad range
of ideological tracks. In practice, only the affluent could take full
advantage of the large selection of educational institutions. Parents with
limited means could not afford the high tuition fees demanded by most
of the Jewish schools, which were forced to operate as private schools
as a result of the government’s policy. The state-run elementary schools,
which operated in accordance with the compulsory education law
(children had to attend school until Grade 7 in cities and until Grade 4
in rural areas), were open to everyone, including Jewish children. The
government also placed at the Jews’ disposal a number of elementary
schools of their own (which were known as “Shabatovka” because there
were no classes on the Sabbath). Nevertheless, it was no simple matter
for Jewish children to be admitted to government-run schools.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The overriding problem, however, was that the Jews were effectively
deprived of the right to run a separate educational system under
government auspices and had to finance most of their educational
institutions, and particularly the high schools, with their own resources.
As a rule only Jewish schools in which the language of instruction was
Polish and in which the Polish educational format prevailed were able
to receive government recognition. Even then this was only with great
difficulty. Jewish parents who wanted to give their children a
high-school education had practically no choice but to establish their
own schools.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Any survey of the Jewish private educational institutions should
begin with the schools of the Tarbut system, founded by the Zionists.
They began operating in Grodno in 1922, and, within a few years,
established two kindergartens, an elementary school, a high school, and
a teachers’ college. Hebrew was the language of instruction in all Tarbut
institutions. Most of the teachers, including the high-school principal,
David Brawer, were from Galicia. In 1927, one-third of the city’s Jewish
children attended a Tarbut school. However, the absence of outside
funding kept tuition fees high, and although partial scholarships were
available, these schools were not a realistic option for the poor.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Grodno, as in many other locales that had previously been situated
in Poland’s eastern frontier area, the percentage of children attending
private schools was high from the outset, as compared with Congress
Poland and Galicia. The reason was that the Russians, too, ran few
government schools, and Jews were not readily admitted.<br><br>

<i>Jewish Elementary Schools.</i> In 1920, the Mizrachi movement founded the
Yavneh religious school. Although it was originally called Torah
va-Da’at, it was renamed in 1925; the language of instruction was also
changed from Yiddish to Polish in order to obtain government
recognition. The curriculum consisted of general as well as Judaic
studies in the national-religious (dati-leummi) stream. Most of the pupils
were from indigent families and could only pay the tuition fees in part,
if at all. However, some wealthy families also sent their children to
Yavneh, where they could receive a deeper grounding in Judaism than
they could in government schools or even in Tarbut. A few teachers in
Yavneh were permanent, but for the most part there was a high staff
turnover because salaries were not paid regularly. Mizrachi also
established a girls’ school, “Havatselet.”<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Grodno had a Talmud Torah boys’ school with an enrollment of
about 600 in the 1930s. Many of the pupils were from poor families who
lived in the Shulhoif. Instruction was conducted in three languages:
Polish, Yiddish, and Hebrew. The teachers belonged to different
streams: assimilationists from Galicia, Bundist-Yiddishists, Zionists and
Poalei Zion Left. Pupils in the Talmud Torah wore uniforms and ate a
communal breakfast. Financing came from the Kehillah budget, but
was insufficient. The institution was constantly in economic difficulties,
and the teachers, who did not receive a regular salary, frequently went
on strike; for a time the school was even in danger of closing.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1924, the CISHO (Central Federation of Jewish Schools) network
established a seven-grade school and a kindergarten in Grodno with a
distinctly proletarian, secular character. For ideological reasons, the
language of instruction was Yiddish. CISHO was founded in Poland in
1921 by the Bund; later Poalei Zion became a partner, even though the
school continued to be controlled by the anti-Zionist Bund. The CISHO
school received government recognition in its very first year of
operation as a result of intensive lobbying efforts.<br><br>

<i>Jewish High Schools.</i> Grodno had two Jewish high schools, one run by
Tarbut and the other a “re’ali ” (science-oriented) school. The Tarbut
school, with its Hebrew-Zionist character and Hebrew as the language
of instruction, was not recognized by the government. Thus it received
no state aid, nor were its graduates entitled to a state diploma; those who
wanted a high-school graduation diploma had to sit for external
examinations in Vilna or Warsaw. Nevertheless, the Tarbut high school
was known for its high academic level and was a popular institution.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the “re’ali ” high school the language of instruction was Polish,
assuring it government recognition and enabling students to take the
final examinations of the state system. Tuition was steep, however
children of civil servants were exempt from payment. The school had
high academic standards and a rich extracurricular program, including
a choir and orchestra, sports activities (there were volleyball and
ping-pong teams), and so forth. The school’s history department even
published a history of Grodno in 1,000 copies, with proceeds from sales
going toward the building of a history library and reading room.
<br><br>
<i>Vocational Schools.</i> As a result of the Polish government’s discriminatory
policy, which prevented Jewish youngsters from attending institutions of
higher education and entering academic professions, many turned to
vocational studies. This was the case not only within proletarian families
but also among those who had completed or partially completed high
school.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1924, the ORT vocational school for Jewish boys in Grodno
(founded 1911) had ninety-four pupils. The academic level was high,
and, in addition to vocational workshops, pupils also studied Polish,
mathematics, physics, mechanics, draftsmanship, and other subjects.
About half the budget was financed by ICA; the rest came from tuition
fees, the Joint Distribution Committee, donations, and the sale of
products made in the workshops, which were known for their high
quality (even the army ordered certain items from the school). Between
1925 and 1930, many of the school’s graduates, assisted by the school’s
administration and the world ORT organization, went to France in
order to specialize. Some of them remained there during World War II.
Many settled in Eretz Israel or in other countries.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1922, ORT opened a vocational school for girls in Grodno,
teaching mainly sewing and other crafts.<br><br>

<i>The Tarbut teachers’ seminary</i> in Grodno was founded in 1926, at the
initiative of David Brawer and Noah Bass. For the first five years, the
curriculum was based on the model of government seminaries and the
Jewish seminary in Vilna, with slight modifications. Most of the
teachers were from Galicia. The first class (fifty-one students) graduated
in 1930/31, and, by 1936, when the college was closed because of a
particular Polish law, it had trained about 200 teachers who were
working throughout the country. The Jewish teachers’ college was
granted the official rights of a recognized teaching institution in Poland.<br><br>
Not all the Jewish children in Grodno were able to continue their
studies after elementary school. Many had to work in order to help
support their families.<br><br><br>
