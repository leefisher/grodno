				<h3>BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS - 5</h3></center><br><br><br>
<i>Political and Zionist Activity.</i> Grodno’s Jews were active in political life on
both the national and municipal levels, within the framework of Jewish
parties or on joint lists with other minorities. In the 1928 elections, 70
percent of the eligible Jews voted, as compared with 60 percent of the
Poles.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The main activities, however, focused on intra-Jewish politics.
Virtually all streams, viewpoints, parties, and movements were repre-sented
in Jewish Grodno. Political activity was at its most intense during
the campaigns for the Sejm and the Senate or, at the local level, for the
municipality and the Va’ad ha-Kehillah. The influence of the Jewish
parties and movements went beyond politics or ideology. They formed
lists to run in elections, established educational institutions, published
journals, and served as social centers.<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After World War I, two large political blocs emerged in Jewish
Grodno. The Zionist camp, the larger of the two, included the General
Zionists, the Zionist left, the national-religious, and the Revisionists; the
non-Zionist camp was comprised, on the one hand, of the anti-Zionist
left — the Bund and the Communist underground — and, on the other
hand, of the ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel and groups of Hassidim, as
well as ordinary haredim, who did not recognize the Agudah.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Zionists maintained lively activity in the city. Nearly every week
groups of settlers left for Eretz Israel, among them not only halutzim, but
also merchants and artisans from the middle class, individuals as well
as entire families. It is estimated that, by 1935, between 4,000 and 5,000
Grodno residents had settled in Eretz Israel.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Zionist movement had a building of its own, which housed the
various factions and organizations: General Zionists, the Hitahdut and
Poalei Zion-ZS, the youth movements, organizations like WIZO, the
national funds (Keren Hayesod and the Jewish National Fund), the
Eretz Israel Office, which dealt with aliyah, the Brenner Library, and
others. Besides ongoing activity the center was also the arena of the
election campaigns for the Zionist institutions and maintained contact
with the surrounding towns of Jeziory, Ostryn, Amdur, Lunna, Nowy
Dwor, Suchowola, Sokolka, Skidel, and Porzecze. At the time of the
1928 elections, there were 12,000 Zionist activists and sympathizers in
Grodno and the region.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In 1921, a year after Poalei Zion split into “left” and “right” wings, the
movement’s young members in Grodno chose to affiliate themselves
with the Zionist-socialist right-wing. In 1925, Poalei Zion merged with
ZS (Zionist-Socialists), and the united organization became the majority
faction in Grodno. Most of its members were salaried workers and
clerks, although there were also those in the liberal professions, and
teachers, artisans, and small shopkeepers. ZS also brought with them to
the Zionist House the Brenner Library, with its thousands of volumes
in Yiddish and Hebrew on the Jewish labor movement and on socialist
Zionism. The library also attracted many readers who were not
organized in youth movements but became the nucleus of the Freiheit
(“Freedom”) movement.<br><br>

</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Poalei Zion-ZS was also active in Grodno’s trade unions and
maintained contacts with non-Jewish workers’ parties. Prior to the
municipal elections of 1929, the party joined with the Bund and the PPS
(Polish Socialist Party) to create a united socialist bloc; afterward the
three parties formed a joint socialist faction in the municipal council.
Poalei Zion-ZS was also influential in the district towns, where it
numbered some 3,000 members and supporters. Poalei Zion Left, on
the other hand, won only slight support in Grodno and the surrounding
district and did not run a list in the 1928 elections.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Another prominent group in Grodno and the area, particularly
among the Jewish intelligentsia, was the Hitahdut (Socialist-Zionist
Labor Party). In the 1920s, this faction did much to strengthen the
He-Halutz organization and promote aliyah. The Hitahdut advocated
the revival of the Hebrew language and was among the initiators and
supporters of the Tarbut school system. In 1928 it had about 2,800
members and supporters in the city.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The national-religious Ha-Mizrachi faction was established after
World War I. In Grodno its members were among the veterans of the
Zionist camp. In 1921, all fourteen of its candidates were elected to the
Community Council, and for years it was the third largest party in
Grodno in terms of the number of electors to the Zionist Congresses.
The movement’s Grodno branch also had various affiliates: Ze’irei
Ha-Mizrachi (“Young Mizrachi”), Torah va-Avodah (“Torah and
Labor”), Ha-Shomer ha-Dati (“Religious Guardian”), and He-Halutz
Ha-Mizrachi. In 1935 a branch of the Center for Religious Artisans was
founded in the city.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Revisionist Movement was established following Ze’ev
Jabotinsky’s resignation from the Zionist Executive in 1923. The new
organization soon acquired an influential status in Grodno, and
Jabotinsky was enthusiastically welcomed when he visited the city. The
movement’s chairman, Dr. Blumstein, also served as the head of the
Kehillah. In addition to the Revisionists’ youth movement, Betar, a
paramilitary group called the Brit ha-Hayal (“Soldier’s Alliance”) was
active. Its members were mainly ordinary working-class folk – porters,
wagoners, butchers, etc. – who were ready to fight for their people, as
they exhibited during the 1935 pogrom.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The non-Zionist camp included the Bund, the first and largest Jewish
socialist party, founded in 1897 in tsarist Russia. However, in inter-war
Poland its influence was initially quite limited. The turning point, which
transformed the Bund into a mass party in Poland, occurred in 1936.
Then the Jews’ economic and security situation deteriorated, while the
immigration quotas to Palestine were slashed, and the United States and
other countries blocked immigration altogether.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Grodno the Bund gained a majority already in 1928, in the elections
to the Va’ad ha-Kehillah, and it had the allegiance of 3,000 members and
supporters. Its main strength came from the Jewish workers in the city’s
veteran tanning industry, but it also drew support from many
intellectuals as well as from workers and artisans.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Communist Party was outlawed in Poland and thus operated
underground, but this did not deter many Jews from joining it, in the
belief that a communist regime would solve the Jewish problem. The
surging antisemitism in Poland in the 1930s only strengthened the
communists and attracted to them respected members of the
community, such as the lawyer Gozhansky.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ultra-Orthodox element in the non-Zionist camp was
represented first and foremost by Agudat Israel. In 1918 Agudat Israel
was still an umbrella organization for many Grodno haredim who did
not belong to any party, including those who rejected the Zionist shekel
(a tax paid on the eve of each Zionist Congress). It was not until a few
years later that the Grodno faction organized itself as a party
subordinate to the center in Warsaw. Its strength lay in the influence it
exerted over the community’s religious institutions, such as houses of
worship, hadarim and yeshivot. In 1934, the party established its own
educational system in Grodno, comprising a kindergarten, the Beth
Ya’acov girls’ school, and later also a college for ultra-Orthodox
teachers. A police report describes the members of Agudat Shlomei
Israel (some 3,000 in number) as being loyal to the government (indeed,
they believed in the ancient dictum, “Dina de-malkhuta Dina” – the law
of the land is binding – and often voted for the ruling party).<br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Besides the parties, all the Jewish youth movements and organizations
in Poland had branches in Grodno. Most were affiliated with a party
and constituted its future membership, yet they enjoyed relative
independence and were not bound to an ideological line dictated from
above. Founded for the most part in the 1920s, the youth movements
conducted their activities in rented premises and sometimes owned a
modest library. Activities included educating young “scouts,” going on
nature hikes, visiting nearby towns, and the like.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The strongest youth movements in Grodno were Dror, Ha-Shomer
ha-Za’ir, and Betar (Revisionists). Dror was founded in 1926, as a union
of He-Halutz ha-Za’ir and Freiheit, the movements of Poalei Zion and
ZS. At the end of 1927, the Dror branch in Grodno was one of the largest
in Poland, numbering some 200 members from all walks of life. The
major ideological difference between the two movements lay in their
choice of language: He-Halutz ha-Za’ir preferred Hebrew, while
Freiheit opted to cultivate Yiddish culture among its young members.
The movement ran eleven amateur groups, including a drama group, a
string orchestra, and the Ha-Koah sports association. The emphasis was
on what they called “Eretz Israel work” and aliyah, including work for
the national funds. The young people also took part in trade-union
activity and in demonstrations of a socialist character and maintained
contacts with branches of the movement in Jeziory, Amdur, Sopockin,
Sokolka, Skidel, and Krinki.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir, a left-wing, pioneering-scouting movement,
inaugurated its activity in Grodno in 1923/24 with a boys’ group called
Ahdut and a girls’ group called Kadimah. Their activity quickly spread
outside the city as well. Young people from all the surrounding towns
joined, and the movement leadership in Grodno organized local
branches for them. Very soon a Grodno district center was established,
which cooperated with the Vilna and Bialystok districts. Among other
programs, the Grodno district organized summer camps for youth from
the entire region. Every year Ha-Shomer groups and their leaders went
to local villages where they rented peasants’ homes and devoted their
time to ideological studies, sports, scouting, and cultivating Hebrew
song. In 1926, a co-ed group called Karit inaugurated a permanent
hakhsharah program at Czenstochowa and Siemiatycze. Although the
group later disbanded, as many of its members settled in Eretz Israel
(among them founders of Kibbutz Ein ha-Horesh) and others pursued
their education, it enshrined the idea of hakhsharah (agricultural
training) and aliyah. A younger group, called Shomriyah (whose
members helped found Kibbutz Ein Shemer), were leaders in the local
branch. Its members attended a hakhsharah program near Sokolka, then
the central training farm at Czenstochowa, and from there proceeded
to Eretz Israel. There was also the Massada group, whose members
were active in the Grodno district leadership (one of them, Mattityahu
Shor, was a founder of Kibbutz Ein ha-Mifratz). Between 1935 and
1939, the Grodno branch numbered about 500 young people aged
twelve to twenty, pupils of Tarbut and working youth. Educational
activity was an important part of movement activity, with those aged
sixteen to seventeen serving as group leaders for the thirteen and
fourteen-year-olds.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of the members of the He-Halutz Organization of the Eretz
Israel ha-Ovedet League were graduates of Ha-Shomer ha-Za’ir and
Dror. The emphasis here was on Zionist-socialist education and on
practical training for aliyah, together with work on behalf of the Zionist
funds, distribution of shekalim for the Zionist Congresses, and activity in
the Tarbut schools.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Betar focused on military education, although it did not scorn
pioneering settlement (maintaining several work and training groups).
Many of the movement’s members reached Eretz Israel in a variety of
ways, only a few by means of immigration certificates which they
obtained as students or as professionals. They often immigrated illegally
on the rickety ships of “Aliyah Bet” (illegal immigration to Palestine).
Besides the three large youth movements, smaller groups such as
Akivah (General Zionists), which in the 1930s had some 150 members,
most from the Polish high school and Tarbut counterpart, could be
found in Grodno. The movement was divided into “battalions,” and its
center was the Beit Ha’am (“People’s House”) building. There was also
the non-Zionist Zukunft (“Future”) movement run by the Bund, but,
unlike the parent organization, it had little impact in Grodno.<br><br>
