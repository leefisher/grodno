<h3>THE GERMAN OCCUPATION - 1</h3></center><br><br>
<b>From the Beginning of the Occupation Until the Establishment of the
Ghettos (June 23, 1941—October 31, 1941)</b>
<br><br>
<i>The Fall of the City.</i> On the night of June 22/23, 1941, the German army
reached the outskirts of Grodno and the Soviet forces retreated in panic,
taking with them only their own people and local residents who had
worked in the administrative apparatus.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The German advance was accompanied by heavy aerial bombard-ment
of the city and the surrounding towns. Before dawn the Germans
launched a massive barrage against the army depots at the edge of the
city. The bombing from the air continued relentlessly throughout the
day, the planes making repeated sorties. Incendiary bombs sparked a
huge fire on both banks of the Nieman. Much of the suburb across the
Nieman went up in flames, including the ancient synagogue. The Jewish
hospital sustained heavy damage.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The terrified Jews, watching the Russians flee, made for the cellars
and shelters (and some were wounded or killed by the bombs that fell
near the cellars). Many Jews, particularly young people, fled wildly,
without any specific destination, on foot, by bicycle, or in wagons. The
roads were littered with bodies and abandoned weapons. Some
managed to board vehicles or to join groups that formed during the
course of the evacuation; but few succeeded in reaching Russia. The
Germans were usually ahead of them and forced them to return to
Grodno.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two months later soldiers from the Spanish Legion who participated
in the combat against the Soviet Union passed through Grodno on their
way to the frontier. They were appalled at the spectacle of ruin and
devastation in every part of Grodno. According to one description,
one-third of the city lay in ruins, and in the “Across the River”
residential suburb not a house remained intact. In total contrast to the
Germans, the Spaniards showed compassion for the Jews during their
short stay in Grodno.<br><br>
<i>The German Administrative Machinery in the Bialystok District and the
Grodno Subdistrict.</i> On July 17, 1941, by a special order, the Bialystok
district was annexed to eastern Prussia as a separate administrative unit,
called “G<i>eneralbezirk Bialystok</i>.” At first Grodno was not included in this
district but remained part of the “<i>Generalkommissariat</i> Byelorussia.”
Then, on September 18, 1941, it was attached to the Bialystok district,
even though the annexation did not become official until March 1942.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About two months after the city’s capture, members of the
Byelorussian National Committee informed on the Polish mayor,
Zawicki, alleging that he was collaborating with the Communists and
the Jews. He was thereupon replaced with a German mayor, Georg
Stein, who also served as “Municipal Commissar” <i>(Stadtkommissar)</i>.
Stein frequently ignored his direct superior, von Ploetz, and consulted
directly with the governor <i>(Oberpresident)</i> of the Bialystok district.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In addition to the civilian system, a security apparatus was responsible
for dealing with terror against the population. The German police in the
Bialystok district was composed of the Order Police (<i>Ordnungspolizei</i>),
the City Police (<i>Schutzpolizei</i> or <i>Schupo</i>), the gendarmerie and the
security units – the Security Police (<i>Sicherheitspolizei</i> or <i>Sipo</i>) and the
Security Service (Sicherheitsdienst or SD). Units of the police and the
Security Service arrived in Grodno in July 1941. A district headquarters
of the SD, the Gestapo, and the Criminal Police (<i>Kriminalpolizei</i> or <i>Kripo</i>)
was established around April 1942, headed by Dr. Wilhelm Altenloh.
When Grodno was attached to the Bialystok district, a Gestapo deputy
office (“Nebenstelle”) was set up there, initially headed by
Kriminalsekretaer Gross, and, from December 1941, by Heinz Errelis.
The office was raised to independent level (“Aussenstelle”) after the
Security Service established a headquarters (KDS) in Bialystok. Errelis
had thirteen men under his command, including his deputy, Schott;
Gross, who was in charge of Jewish affairs; Kurt Wiese, who would
afterward become the commandant of Ghetto One; Otto Streblow,
commandant of Ghetto Two; Karl Rinzler, commandant of the
Kielbasin concentration camp; Niestroj; three interpreters, two drivers,
and two stenographers.<br><br>
<i>Creation of the Judenrat.</i> At the end of June 1941, two German officers
ordered lawyer Izaak Gozhanski to establish a Jewish representative
body. However, Gozhanski was evasive, claiming his German was not
good enough. Instead he recommended David Brawer, who, since
1939, was the headmaster of the local Tarbut school. Brawer, too, saw
the appointment as a horrendous disaster, but was given no choice. He
was summoned to the military commander and ordered to form a
Judenrat of ten people within twenty-four hours and to lead it as “head
of the Jewish population in the city of Grodno” (“Obman der Juedische
Bevoelkerung der Stadt Grodno”). Brawer asked all the Jewish
organizations and parties (as they had existed until September 1939) to
appoint representatives. On June 28, 1941, they already met.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was a turbulent session. Some of those present argued against
establishing a Jewish representation for fear that this would only
facilitate the persecutions; others argued that the serious situation of the
Jews in the city called for the immediate creation of a representative
body that would work both to moderate the German decrees and to
relieve the physical distress of the population. Many had been left
destitute by the great fire that had heralded the occupation, and the
number of sick and needy had increased greatly. It was imperative to
provide them with clothing, footwear, food and medical services.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The advocates of representation won out, and at the meeting it was
decided to establish a Judenrat. Even though officially its function was
limited to carrying out the occupier’s orders, in practice the Judenrat
executed a wide range of functions, including those that in the past had
been the responsibility of extra-communal elements. Thus, by the time
the Jews were incarcerated in the ghettos, the Judenrat was already
dealing with a broad array of community affairs. First to be activated
were the departments for medical aid and relief and the labor
department, which tried to introduce order into the forced-labor
mobilizations and put an end to the spate of kidnappings (see below).
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
By September 7, 1941, the Judenrat had more than doubled in size, to
twenty-four members, as is evident from the list that Brawer had to
submit to the German Civil Administration when the Jews were placed
under its authority. The list included individuals from various strata of
the Jewish population who had been active in the community before
September 1939, and it specified their roles and functions. One of the
names on the list was that of the lawyer Izaak Gozhanski.<br><br>

<i>Decrees, Kidnappings, Murders.</i> With the occupation the Jews were
immediately placed outside the law. Their lives and security were of no
consequence or concern. Jewish youngsters disappeared without a trace
from the streets; a similar fate befell hospitalized adults and children,
the elderly in old-age homes, and members of the Jewish intelligentsia.
An Einsatzgruppen (the German execution units) report of July 13,
1941, includes a survey of operations executed by the Einsatz-kommando
in which ninety-six Jews were put to death in Grodno and
Lida. The true number was probably far higher; according to one
source,9 the Germans combed the town with lists in hand and arrested
hundreds of members of the educated and intellectual stratum. At least
100 were shot.<ul><hr width="85%">

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the absence of law, the lives of the Jews were regulated by orders
and edicts, some of which were published post factum. About twelve
days after the Germans entered the city, all the Jews were required to
register and the word “Jude” was stamped on their identity cards. Soon
a whole series of restrictions and prohibitions were enforced. For
example, Jews were forbidden to walk on the sidewalks; they had to
walk in the middle of the road in single file (“duck-walk”).
Consequently, many were hit by passing vehicles, and Jews arriving at
hospitals after being injured in road accidents became a common sight.
Jews were also forbidden to use public transportation or to enter places
of leisure, sports arenas, theaters, museums and libraries; nor were they
permitted to own a vehicle, radio, or even a cow or horse. On the street
Jews had to lift their hat to passing Germans. All contact between Jews
and non-Jews was banned.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On June 30, 1941, an order issued in Grodno made it mandatory for
Jews to wear an identifying badge. At first this was a white armband with
a blue Star of David; a month later the armband was replaced by two
large yellow patches worn on the left side of the chest and on the left of
the back. Children were exempt from this decree. Anyone caught
without the patches was severely punished, not only risking arrest but
having to endure a savage beating that left the victim ailing for weeks
or even months.
