<h3>THE GERMAN OCCUPATION - 6</h3></center><br><br>
			<center><h4>AFTER THE WAR</h4></center><br>
On July 14, 1944, Grodno was liberated by the Red Army. The “Across
the River” suburb and Lososna were liberated ten days later, after a stiff
resistance of the Germans. Some forty to fifty Jews who had been in
hiding in the city and its environs emerged, and they were soon
followed by the return of some of the youngsters who had fought with
the partisans. Slowly but steadily, other survivors arrived, most of them
from the USSR, in the hope of finding relatives and friends who had
come through the war. But most of the returnees quickly left. Many
went to Palestine after passing through several transit stations in
Europe; some immigrated to the United States or Latin America; and
others made their way to Russia. There were about 200 survivors in
Grodno. In the following years also Jews from other places settled in
Grodno, and slowly their number rose until it reached approximately
2,000 people.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the emigration waves of the years 1945-1946, 1957-1958, and
1972-1973, many Jews left Grodno – most of them to Israel, but also to
the United States and other countries.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Before the “<i>Peristroika</i>” period, no Jewish life existed in Grodno; there
was no synagogue, no Jewish cultural events, not even a Jewish
cemetery. In the 1950s the authorities turned the main Jewish cemetery
in Grodno into a stadium. The Jewish cemetery in the “Across the
River” suburb was closed as well, and the Jews had no choice but to
bury their dead in the non-Jewish cemetery.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The changes that transpired in the former Soviet Union in the late
1980s gradually brought a rejuvenation of Jewish life in Grodno as well.
On October 18, 1989, a Jewish cultural association was established that
bore the name of Leib Naidus. Since April 1992, a small Jewish religious
community exists in Grodno, and the authorities returned to them the
Great Synagogue – although in very bad condition. Dr. Felix Zandman,
today the owner of the “Vishay” electronics concern, financed the
renovation. That same year a Sunday School for Jewish children was
opened, where they learn Hebrew, Jewish history, Jewish religion etc.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this period Jewish emigration from Grodno, mainly to Israel,
increased. By the end of 1995, some 1,000 Jews remained in Grodno
(out of a population of more than 250,000 inhabitants). Of them only
five are former Grodno residents who survived the Holocaust, returned
to their native town, and chose to remain.
A request by Salomon Zhukovsky to the city’s Soviet mayor to erect
a monument to the Jews of Grodno who had perished in the Holocaust
was rejected. The mayor claimed that insufficient documentary
evidence existed about such a large number of victims. It was not until
Zhukovsky showed the mayor a series of publications that contained
documentary proof,<sup>35</sup> that the municipality agreed to his request. On
March 12, 1992, a plaque commemorating the Holocaust victims from
Grodno was placed at the entrance to the ghetto.

<i>Trials of War Criminals.</i> Of the four major war criminals who were
involved in the annihilation of the Jews of Grodno and its surroundings
– Heinz Errelis, Kurt Wiese, Otto Streblow, and Karl Rinzler – the first
two were brought to trial. Errelis’s deputy Schott, killed himself after the
war. Streblow was apparently killed in action, and Rinzler, the sadistic
commandant of Kielbasin camp, disappeared. At the very end of the
war (May 12, 1945), the British arrested Errelis, but, in 1947, he escaped
from a POW camp at Rimini, Italy, and disappeared without a trace.
Wiese also vanished. It was Schott’s interrogation that led to the arrest
of Errelis and Wiese. In 1960, a few survivors from Grodno were invited
to testify at the trials in Ludwigsburg, Germany. Both war criminals
were convicted, but Wiese was freed on bail and disappeared again; he
was apparently smuggled out of the country by the Nazi underground
organization that helped war criminals escape. In 1964, the Nazi-hunter
Simon Wiesenthal discovered his whereabouts, and he was caught
while trying to reach Egypt. In 1966–1967 he was tried in Bielefeld,
Germany, together with Errelis and other Gestapo personnel who had
been active in the Bialystok area. The court acquitted Errelis of charges
of direct involvement in murder for lack of evidence. He was found
guilty only of complicity in the murder of the Jews of Grodno in Ghetto
One and of the Jews in the Bialystok ghetto, to which he was posted
following the liquidation of the Grodno ghettos. The sentences were
handed down in April 1967. Errelis received six and a half years in
prison and was deprived of German citizenship for five years. Wiese
was convicted of murder and complicity in murder and received seven
consecutive life terms. In 1968, the two were also tried in Cologne,
together with other war criminals who had been active in Grodno.<sup>37</sup>
