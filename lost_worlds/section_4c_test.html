<h3>THE GERMAN OCCUPATION - 3</h3></center><br><br>
<h3>Confiscations and Forced Labor</h3></center><br><br>
<i>Confiscations, “Contributions,” Dispossession.</i> From the first day of the
occupation, a campaign of confiscation and robbery was launched.
Before the Jews were incarcerated in the ghetto, German officers and
soldiers would visit their homes and take whatever caught their fancy.
The authorities also constantly ordered the Judenrat to supply them
with furniture, clothing, eating utensils, footwear and so forth. On one
occasion the Germans demanded thirty chairs and thirty white
tablecloths within two days; another time it was cutlery, furniture,
boots, and curtains.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There were also “contributions” (ransom payments) in money and
valuables. Already at the end of June 1941, the Jews were obligated to
raise one million rubles, with the Judenrat’s financial department
responsible for the implementation. Within two months the Jews were
told to “contribute” some $200,000. The Grodno municipality also took
its share of Jewish property, exploiting the existing decrees and adding
some of its own. If differences arose between the municipality and the
Judenrat, the Germans automatically sided with the former. A case in
point concerned the restrictions that the municipality imposed on
workshops that had existed for dozens of years and on those that
received permits on July 23. The municipality barred the operation of
various types of workshops – locksmiths, sewing, sheet-metal – and also
carpentries, bakeries, and shoemakers’ shops. On July 24, Brawer
complained to the military commander. Two days later he was
informed that the Germans supported the municipality’s stand.
Moreover, the commander ordered the municipal administration to
place “Aryans” in the Jews’ shops so as to ensure continuity in the city’s
economic life.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two months later, when the Jews on two main streets – Dominikanska
and Orzeszkowej – were forced to leave their homes and move
elsewhere, they were forbidden to take their belongings.<br><br><br>
<b>The First Year in the Ghettos (November 1941–November 1942): The
“Stable” Period</b><br><br>
<i>Establishment of the Ghettos.</i> In November 1941, shortly after Grodno was
annexed to the Bialystok district, the city’s Jews were transferred to two
ghettos about 2 km. apart from each other. This separation would later
facilitate the Germans’ ability to exterminate the occupants. The
smaller ghetto was liquidated a year after its establishment, while the
larger one survived it by a few months. Two main criteria determined
the ghettos’ location: less need to transfer the Jews from place to place
within the city; and an attempt to worsen their situation to the
maximum by concentrating them in areas where the physical
surroundings – sanitation, water and electricity, roads, etc. – were not
adequate for the occupants’ needs.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A week before the Jews entered the ghettos, Commissar von Ploetz
issued an order to the commissars of the various units:<ul>
<i>Jews cannot own real estate. When the Jews enter the ghetto, they
will lose their property. Aryans who lived in the ghetto or have
property there should receive in exchange the houses that will be
emptied of Jews. Jews’ real estate belongs to the Reich.</i><sup>10</sup><br>

<br><hr width="85%">
</ul>
The first ghetto (Ghetto One) was established in the city’s ancient,
central section, in the area of the fortress, around the synagogue
compound (Shulhoif ). Jews had constituted the majority of the
population in this area even before the founding of the ghetto, but now
some 15,000 Jews were crammed into an area less than half a square
km. It covered the synagogue courtyard as far as Wilenska Street on one
side and as far as the northern section of Zamkowa (renamed Burg)
Street on the other side. Surrounding the ghetto was a 2-meter-high
fence, part of which passed through the backyards of houses along
Dominikanska (renamed Hindenburg) Street, one of the city’s main
thoroughfares. The entry to the ghetto was from Zamkowa Street,
where it met Ciasna Street, which led into the ghetto. The fence on
Zamkowa Street was erected between the sidewalk and the road, and
Jews were forbidden to use the front entrance to the houses on that
street. Some of the houses on the other side of the street were
demolished. The area and boundaries of the ghetto were not fixed; as
the transports proceeded it kept diminishing in size, until finally it
included only a few buildings on Zamkowa Street.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The second ghetto (Ghetto Two) was created in the Slobodka suburb,
behind the railway tracks, to the right of the road leading to Skidel
Street, opposite the market square and the barracks area. This part of
the city was broader and more open, with fewer houses. Some 10,000
Jews were incarcerated in this ghetto, which was larger in size than the
main ghetto but more dilapidated. It, too, was sealed off with a fence,
which ran along Skidel Street parallel to the road. The entrance to the
ghetto was from Artyleryjska (afterward renamed Kremer) Street.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Generally Jews were sent to one ghetto or the other based on their
work; the first ghetto was intended for “productive” workers, the second
for the “unproductive.” Consequently, even the Jews of Grodno were
led into believing that Ghetto One was meant primarily for skilled
workers and that its occupants enjoyed automatic protection, whereas
the authorities had no use for those in Ghetto Two and their lives were
therefore in danger. Before they entered the ghetto the professionals
were ordered to obtain a work permit. Panic spread throughout the city,
and long lines formed outside the Judenrat offices for the permit. Many
were granted such certificates and entered the first ghetto even though
they were not artisans, while some vitally needed professionals were
forced into Ghetto Two.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The evacuation of the Jews from their homes and their transfer to the
ghetto was executed swiftly and without consideration for the harsh
weather. The Jews were given only six hours (from noon until 6 P.M.) to
move their belongings – without the use of vehicles – and the result was
that thousands of Jews streamed toward the gates of the ghetto. The
night brought with it the first snow, and many of the evacuees fashioned
homemade sleds to facilitate their move. Although the authorities
barred anyone who entered the ghetto from leaving again, many
managed to go back and forth to their homes several times in order to
remove additional items. Frequently the Jews encountered Polish
hooligans who attacked and looted them, despite the authorities’
explicit prohibition of the presence of non-Jews in the streets while the
Jews were being transferred to the ghettos.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Those whose houses were inside the ghetto had to share them with
the newcomers, whereas the Jews who were evicted from their homes
were ordered to find alternative lodgings. Some acted promptly, seized
an apartment, and moved some of their belongings. Others turned for
help to the Judenrat’s housing department, which was established at the
same time as the ghettos. Housing became an acute problem and
preoccupied the entire presidium of the Judenrat. Because of the
overcrowding and the shortage of flats, hundreds of families remained
without a roof over their heads, and the streets were filled with piles of
furniture and bedding. The synagogue and the batei midrash were also
converted into quasi-lodgings. Those with good connections received
better apartments, but the Judenrat realized that a general solution had
to be found, as winter was approaching. A housing committee, headed
by lawyer Fuerstenberg, was set up, and within two or three weeks an
arrangement had been found for everyone. To relieve the congestion,
the housing department turned to the construction department, which
renovated old buildings and in some cases actually built new
apartments. For example, the Slobodka barracks, which became the site
of the Judenrat office in Ghetto Two, were completely renovated.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Safety and order inside the ghetto were the responsibility of the
Jewish Police, while outside the ghetto the German <i>Schupo</i> was in charge
– until November 2, 1942, when the ghettos were closed. German
policemen, under the command of Franz Osterode, manned the
entrance to the ghetto, checking exit passes and examining those
returning from work. In particular they searched the starving Jews for
food they might be trying to smuggle into the ghetto. Serving under
Osterode were some 40-50 German policemen and a similar number of
local auxiliary police.
The Gestapo headquarters in Grodno was located on Hoovera Street
(the house of Dr. Finkel). After the ghettos were sealed off permanently,
on November 2, 1942, and no one was permitted to enter or leave, the
Gestapo moved its command post into a former Jewish shop near the
entrance to Ghetto One, to facilitate more efficient supervision of the
Jews’ movements.
<br><br>
<i>Organizing Life in the Ghettos.</i> Upon the establishment of the two ghettos,
the Grodno Judenrat also split into two. In the first ghetto its offices were
in the three buildings of the former Yavneh School on Zamkowa Street,
and in the second ghetto, as mentioned, in the renovated barracks. In
both ghettos parallel institutions and departments were set up to deal
with key spheres, such as finances, health and clinics, work, kitchens,
and so forth. The heads of the two Judenrats were both lawyers, Izaak
Gozhanski in Ghetto One and Avraham Zadai in Ghetto Two, and both
were subordinate to David Brawer.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For a time the ghetto became a kind of autonomous Jewish city, with
only technical connections to the general municipal area, such as for the
supply of power and water. The Jews’ incarceration and their severance
from government and municipal services forced the Judenrat to assume
many new tasks, such as providing food and housing, maintaining
workshops, and ensuring the operation of such services as health,
police, courts, and so forth. The relative quiet that characterized the first
year of the ghettos enabled the Judenrat to ease the Jews’ plight by
creating a very large bureaucratic apparatus, which in itself became a
source of livelihood for many ghetto occupants. Some 850 individuals
were employed by the Judenrats of the two ghettos. The Grodno
Judenrat consisted of thirteen departments, which dealt with nearly
every facet of life. The departments’ power and authority were
dependent on the conditions in the ghetto and on the nature and scale
of the Germans’ demands. Thus, the supply, work, and confiscations
departments wielded more power than the others.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Judenrat’s staff was exempt from forced labor and, for a time,
from transports as well. The Judenrat also endeavored to protect the
core of the community’s intelligentsia as long as it was able.
<br><br>
<i>Financial and Economic Operations.</i> The Judenrat took upon itself an
enormous range of tasks, and its expenses were correspondingly
immense. Large sums had to be paid to the municipality in exchange
for the apartments in the ghettos and the supply of water and electricity.
The Judenrat also underwrote the renovation of residential dwellings
and of offices for the Germans; it developed workshops, maintained
health and sanitation services, assisted the needy, and paid wages to its
staff. In addition, it frequently had to bribe Germans with cash or with
goods such as furs, clothing, new furniture, and the like.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The finance department – headed by Yehoshua Suchovlanski, a
former Grodno deputy mayor who was a gifted economist and a pillar
of the ghetto economy – coped successfully with these prodigious
difficulties and was able to cover the Judenrat’s vast expenditures.
Established in June 1941, the finance department was ordered, as its
first task, to collect from the Jewish community a ransom payment of
one million rubles for the Germans.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Initially only the affluent were taxed, but gradually a broader
taxation system came into being which remained in effect until the
ghettos’ liquidation. The Judenrat’s revenues derived from property tax
(paid by the wealthy), income tax, rent, income from the ghetto
workshops, payments for electricity and water, and payments for
release from forced labor, all according to means.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The concentration of the Jews in the ghettos was a devastating blow
to their economic activity. To begin with, they were cut off completely
from the longstanding and vital economic ties which they had formed
with the city’s non-Jews.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Judenrat head Brawer considered the supply of food to the ghetto to
be one of the Judenrat’s major functions. Thanks to his influence and
his intercession with the German army and the civilian authorities, he
was able to procure for the ghetto a larger food allocation. Ya’akov
Efron, the director of the supply department, also spared no effort, and
the combination of his organizational skill and the intensive endeavors
of the Judenrat overall, meant that the food situation in the Grodno
ghetto was less severe than in other ghettos. True, as was usually the
case, the affluent enjoyed better conditions and the poor made do with
the scraps; but the fact remains that in Grodno, in contrast to other
ghettos in Poland, no one died of starvation.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In both ghettos, food was distributed to holders of ration cards at
special stations. The supply department provided the bakeries with
flour, wood or coals for fuel, and salt. The ghetto occupants received
about 200 grams of bread a day in return for a token payment. The
Judenrat also ran a butcher shop, in which meat (usually horse meat)
was available from time to time for card-holders. Potatoes were stored
in the cellar of the Great Synagogue and were distributed there.
In both ghettos the public kitchens played a major role. The kitchen
in Ghetto One was located in the Great Synagogue (to the left of the
main entrance), and in Ghetto Two in the basement of the match
factory. The commodities were furnished by the supply department.
Meals were usually served “with without” (i.e., without meat or fat), but
a hot, nourishing broth was prepared and served with a piece of bread
(50-100 grams). Occasionally, when the kitchens received a bit of meat
or some bones, a separate pot was used for those who wanted kosher
food.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On some days the kitchen in Ghetto One served up to 3,000 meals,
in return for a token payment – the only hot meal for hundreds of
families. The poor and the indigent received meals free of charge, upon
presentation of a document from the social-welfare department. The
kitchens were particularly important in the winter months, when the
shortage of trees left whole families without fuel and subsequently they
could not heat water for drinking. In return for a minuscule payment,
or even for free, a hot drink could be had in the kitchens (barley coffee)
from 5 A.M. to 8 A.M. and from 7 P.M. until 9 P.M. Nearly all the workers
came in for a “morning coffee.”
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In both ghettos, plots of land and gardens were worked at the
initiative of the supply department. In Ghetto One the land in question
was located in the old Jewish cemetery; in Ghetto Two it was the large
square opposite the Jewish orphanage, on the way to Skidel (formerly
the He-Halutz garden). Some plots were located next to Yosilevich’s
match factory, where potatoes, beets, cabbages, and onions were
grown. The work was done by Jewish gardeners. For a time the
Germans let the Jews go on working their former gardens, which were
now outside the ghetto, particularly in the residential suburb. An
agricultural course lasting more than six months was held, and the
participants were exempt from work.
<br><br>
<i>Work Inside and Outside the Ghetto.</i> The occupants of the Grodno ghetto,
like their brethren in many other ghettos across Poland, adopted the
slogan, “salvation through work.” In other words, nearly everyone
believed that as long as the Germans considered the ghetto occupants
to be productive elements who were useful to their economy, they
would let them live. The Germans, for their part, helped cultivate the
idea that work inside and outside the ghetto for their war industry would
protect the Jews from extermination. The Judenrat also advocated this
approach. Brawer even went to Bialystok in order to study methods of
establishing and managing small factories, and a variety of workshops
and plants were set up in the ghetto to supply goods to the city proper,
to the army, and to the Gestapo.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jews from both ghettos also worked outside. The labor department,
which had been set up in the first days of the Judenrat in order to supply
the required number of Jews for forced labor and other duties, was in
charge of arranging the work in the ghettos. The gathering place for the
Jewish workers was by the gate. In the pre-ghetto period all the Jews had
to report for work daily, although they were taken outside for forced
labor only a few times a week. Those who worked outside the ghetto
received a food card and were entitled to bread and meat according to
the rations given to the working class.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The labor department had a large bureaucratic apparatus that kept an
exact record of all Jews, the fit and the unfit for work, according to their
professions and their labor brigades. Some brigades had a better
reputation than others and workers vied with one another to join them.
Such were the brigades that worked for the Gestapo; to get a job with
them meant safety for the workers and their families. Because so many
wanted to join these brigades, their leaders could earn good money in
return for accepting workers. But some other brigade leaders were also
considered “strong” and “well-connected,” and took money from
workers. Bribe-taking incensed the Judenrat, which monitored the
heads of the departments and frequently replaced them. Orders for
workers came from the German Ministry of Labor, which also issued
the work permits for individuals and for groups. Some Jews worked
separately as skilled professionals and received personal permits,
whereas for groups that did a particular job a collective permit was
issued stating the number of workers. In the latter case, those in charge
could maneuver and mobilize different people each time. Work permits
carried a time limit but could be extended. They had to state the exact
place where the work was being done and the time it commenced. Jews
worked ten hours a day, and anyone who was late or left the site without
permission was punished. Some were even executed on the charge that
they displayed contempt for work or because they had been playing
cards during working hours.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Artisans were paid 0.45 marks an hour, trained workers received 0.38
marks an hour, and simple laborers got 0.35 marks. Women were paid
75 percent of the men’s salary. As already mentioned, half the salary
was deducted for the Grodno Commissar’s office, and the remainder
also did not reach the workers directly but was paid to the Judenrat.
The records of the payments that were transferred to the municipality
for Jewish workers show that in addition to working for the army and
the city, they were utilized in various factories – for the manufacture of
leather, tiles, juices, bricks and plywood, and beer – and in a sawmill, a
carpentry workshop, on roads, in the offices of the district
administration, and elsewhere.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Most of the Jews preferred to work outside the ghetto, as this entitled
them to higher salaries, better food rations, and even enabled them to
smuggle food into the ghetto. Moreover, the work permit gave its
holders a sense of protection from the various orders and edicts. Yet
there were also wealthy Jews who had the means to find others to
replace them, paying both them and the Judenrat. To fill the work
quotas, Jewish policemen, in return for a few marks, would sometimes
round up beggars and send them to work in place of the well-to-do.
Eventually the system became institutionalized and the labor
department itself made such arrangements.
<br><br>
<i>The Ghetto Shops and Workshops.</i> Inside the ghetto there were a number
of private shops that sold smuggled goods or products manufactured in
the ghetto in privately owned workshops. The latter produced shoes,
sheet-metal, garments and other necessities of life. Some of their
products were destined for clients outside the ghetto. The Judenrat’s
commerce and crafts department collected a tax on signs. The stands
were only semi-legal, and the shopkeepers would close their businesses
whenever Gestapo and SS personnel, or even ordinary Germans,
appeared in the ghetto – usually to inquire about the origin of the items
on sale.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some well-to-do artisans established small plants in the ghetto; two
of them produced cooking oil (one belonged to Meir Trachtenberg),
and the others made artificial honey, starch, candies, and flour. Their
owners became “wealthy” (in terms of the place and the time) and had to
pay taxes to the Judenrat’s finance, commerce and crafts departments.
As a rule, these plants were kept hidden from the Germans.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Von Ploetz, the Grodno subdistrict commissar, took a leaf from the
Bialystok ghetto and opened additional workshops in Grodno. The idea
was to produce items for the German war economy and to supply the
personal needs of army and Gestapo personnel stationed in Grodno.
The new workshops were therefore considered to be of prime
importance. Among their products were shoes and boots in large
quantities, brown shirts and skiing equipment for the army, and felt
shoes for the German police. The German-run workshops received
large orders from the army, as for instance: 4,000 army shirts, 20,000
pairs of slippers, 30,000 pairs of felt shoes, 15,000 pairs of leather shoes,
work clothes, processing 40,000 meters of cloth, padded jackets and
trousers, as well as large numbers of brushes and paintbrushes. The
Germans supplied the raw materials.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In their workshops the Germans employed the most highly skilled
workers; the permits issued to them were considered tantamount to “life
insurance.” Many, then, were prepared to pay a great deal to be
assigned to these workshops. Others drew on their connections in the
Judenrat, a situation that made for much envy.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The City Commissar kept close watch on the Jews’ work. If the
productivity rates fell, he used severe pressure and even threatened to
send all involved to a “work-education” camp, where these unproductive
elements would be re-educated under strict supervision. And indeed,
such a camp had been established by the Grodno municipality. The
detention in the camp usually lasted from two weeks to six months; it
contained separate sections for “Aryans,” for Jews and for women. The
camp was first activated after Easter 1942, but there is nothing to suggest
that Jews from Grodno and its surroundings were “re-educated” there.
