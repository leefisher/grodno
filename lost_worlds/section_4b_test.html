As we have already indicated, the authorities did not always publish a
judicial order before implementing it. A flagrant example of this
method was forced labor, which was introduced immediately after the
occupation. It was not until two months later, on August 16, 1941, that
the relevant official order was published. The Jews had to report every
morning near the synagogue, from where they were taken by
government bodies, such as the army or the municipality, to work at
various types of labor. The general work companies cleared stones from
the streets, repaired roads, and cleaned the barracks of the occupying
forces. Public works such as clearing snow, paving roads, and cleaning
streets were considered to be for the general good and were not
recompensed. The order was accompanied by the threat of punishment
against those who did not work, but even those who did were beaten,
abused and humiliated.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Only those with vital professions, who received work permits, were
assured permanent employment and were spared the brutal experience
of the mass concentration in the morning and the grueling unskilled
labor.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When the Grodno subdistrict was annexed to the Bialystok district (see
below), the laws and regulations in effect in the latter were also applied
to the former. On October 15, 1941, the first official order was
promulgated for the entire district regarding forced labor; it specified
the ages of those who were obligated to work – males aged fourteen to
sixty and women aged fourteen to fifty-five. A more detailed order from
April 1, 1942, was directed to all the district’s Jews, stipulating execution
as the punishment for evasion.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On September 29, 1941, Abraham Lifszyc, director of the Judenrat’s
commerce and industry department, submitted to the city
administration a list of craftsmen and skilled workers for whom he
sought work permits. The list mentions an extraordinary range of
professions: technicians, locksmiths, brushers, milliners, wood carvers,
chimney sweeps, tile layers, road pavers, wagoners, soap makers, pot
menders, blacksmiths, sheet-metal workers, barrel builders, furriers,
watchmakers, bakers, stove stokers, and many more – all told, 600
professions and crafts.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In theory, the work permits were intended solely for skilled craftsmen,
but the Judenrat’s labor department tried to assist the members of the
liberal professions as well and was sometimes able to obtain craftsmen’s
certificates for them. Jewish permit-holders were supposed to earn 60
percent of the wages of local workers. Of this, 50 percent was deducted
for the Municipal Commissar, 12 percent went to social insurance, and
the remaining 38 percent was transferred to the Judenrat, which had to
supply food. The workers themselves received no wages.<br><br><br>
