				<h3>BETWEEN THE WORLD WARS - 1</h3></center><br><br><br>
<b>Demographic Changes</b><br><br>
Under the terms of the Treaty of Riga (March 18, 1921), Poland
received a large part of the territory that was claimed by both the
Ukraine and Byelorussia. Poland’s eastern boundary was demarcated
more or less along the Russo-Polish border that had been set following
the second partition of Poland in 1793. The Poles viewed this as a
compromise solution between their aspirations for “the historic
borders” and what they considered their ethnic territory. Within these
“compromise borders” the proportion of non-Poles within the
population was estimated at about 40 percent. In the eastern part of the
country, the Byelorussians and the Ukrainians constituted the majority
in the rural areas, but in the big cities the Poles and the Jews made up
the majority. More than a million Germans resided primarily in the
southwest of the country, in regions that in the past had been annexed
to Prussia, while the Jews constituted slightly more than 10 percent of
the population.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
For reasons connected with the “geography of elections,” the Polish
authorities enlarged the territory of Grodno by annexing to it suburbs
and nearby villages. One result of this move was to reduce the relative
proportion of the Jews in Greater Grodno. This demographic trend
persisted through the 1920s and the 1930s, due to a combination of
factors. Grodno, like most of the medium-sized cities and towns in
Poland at this time, was feeling the consequences of rapid urbanization,
a process that was most blatant among the Jews; many young people
from Grodno sought their future in the larger towns and big cities. The
situation was compounded by the Jews’ low rate of natural increase: 8.9
percent, as compared with 18.5 percent among the general population.
Thus, the proportion of the Jews in Grodno’s population declined
appreciably. Within ten years, between the censuses of 1921 and 1931,
the proportion of the city’s Jews dwindled from 54 percent to 42.6
percent.<br><br>

The Jews’ Economic and Occupational Structure<br><br>
The standard of living among Grodno’s Jews declined continuously in
the inter-war period. Most made their livings as shopkeepers, peddlers
and artisans; only a small group, consisting of industrialists, large
merchants, and some employed in the liberal professions, enjoyed
economic prosperity of one degree or another. The annexation of the
Grodno region to Poland at the end of World War I and the loss of the
huge Russian market meant that the population was dependent on the
very limited internal Polish market. Since the Poles did not introduce
agrarian reform, peasants with small plots ran economically
independent households and did not need goods or services provided
by artisans. Moreover, the Poles deprived Grodno of its status as the
administrative center of a broad district; the new center was Bialystok,
which was far from the border with Lithuania and from the Byelo-russian
villages and closer to the center of Poland, a development that
played a role in the deterioration of the economic situation in Grodno.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These and other developments seriously affected the livelihood of the
population in general and of the Jews in particular. The Polish
authorities also adopted a consistent policy of removing the Jews from
their economic positions. Moreover, the government gave Poles in the
Grodno region, as throughout the eastern border area, land for
settlement; loans and housing assistance; various concessions in
commerce, industry, and small industry; positions in the government
and the army; tax exemptions; and other benefits that were not given
to Jews. At the same time, the taxation and levies system, together with
the government’s nationalization and monopolistic practices, adversely
affected the Jews, who lost jobs in the government-run railway,
telegraph, and postal services and suffered discrimination in the private
sector as well. The Jews also suffered from the law-enforcement
methods. The officials involved were at best unsympathetic to them and
many were outright Jew-haters. The police hounded Jewish
shopkeepers, fining them for every violation – real or imagined – of the
sanitation regulations.

</center>
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The years of economic depression radicalized internal conflicts and
heightened anti-Jewish discrimination. The right-wing parties and the
Polish population competed in making up antisemitic slogans and in
conjuring up extreme solutions for the “Jewish problem.” Only one
party, the PPS (Polish Socialist Party), occasionally objected to the
surging antisemitism, but to little effect.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<i>Commerce</i> was the primary and major economic sector on which the
government’s anti-Jewish policy was focused. Already on December
18, 1919, the Polish government prohibited the opening of shops on
Sundays and on Christian holidays. Although this was not necessarily
directed against the Jews, it most certainly caused a serious reduction in
their incomes. Later, the general economic crisis was fertile ground for
an economic boycott of the Jews. Local and national merchants’
associations launched a vigorous propaganda campaign against their
Jewish colleagues under the slogan “<i>Swoj do swego</i>” (“let everyone turn ´
to his own people”). The drive received the blessing of the rightist OZN
(United National Camp) government.
Prime Minister Florian Slawoi-Skladkowski made clear his stand on
the Jewish question on June 6, 1936, when he said, “No one in Poland
must be harmed, as a fair landlord does not permit anyone to hurt
people in the house; [however] an economic struggle – of course
[“<i>Owszem</i>”]!” That last word was understood as the go-ahead to
discriminate against the Jews by means of extreme economic measures.
A highly inflammatory antisemitic propaganda campaign was
launched. The press published defamatory articles and virulent anti-semitic
caricatures; anti-Jewish graffiti and posters appeared on walls of
buildings; Jew-baiting leaflets were distributed on the streets; protest
vigils were held in front of Jewish businesses; and shops owned by
non-Jews were marked, the latter in some cases against the owners’ will.
The Poles introduced the term “Christian shop,” and, in the late 1930s,
even carriage drivers bore the inscription “Christian carriages” on their
caps. Jewish suppliers were also boycotted.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The intensive boycott propaganda affected both the simple folk and
the educated. Not a day passed without an article appearing about a
meeting, a lecture, protest vigils, the distribution of antisemitic
handbills, and so forth. For example, the “Swoj do swego” group ´
organized a “solidarity month” and a “Polish merchant’s day”;
merchants from Grodno and the surrounding area sent a delegation to
Warsaw to demand that no Jews be given tobacco concessions; the
nationalist-antisemitic “Narodowa Demokracja” (National Democracy)
party, known as Endecja, held a mass rally and set up a special
department to work for the economic dispossession of the Jews. The
department circulated propaganda leaflets that played on the emotions
of the Christians, with assertions such as “There is no Poland without
Polish commerce”; “Pole, defend Polish commerce”; “Poland without
Jews is a strong Poland”; “Buying from Jews enriches them”; and “Buy
from Christians in order to provide bread and jobs to the unemployed
and to strengthen the state.” The merchants’ association, unwilling to
stop at mere words, resorted to threats by blacklisting those who
maintained commercial ties with Jews.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
These aggressive economic measures were partially successful; quite
a few Jewish merchants lost their clients and were forced to close.
Nevertheless, some Poles continued to buy from Jews for the simple
reason that their prices were lower.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
State intervention led to the ouster of Jews from several economic
branches in which the Jews of Grodno and the region held a prominent
place, such as forest products and grains. The Jews’ diminishing share in
commerce during the inter-war period was consistent and unremitting.
But if, until the mid-1930s, it stemmed mainly from socioeconomic
trends among the population, the last five years before the war saw a
constant intensification of deliberate anti-Jewish policies and harsh
propaganda. In 1932, 694 of Grodno’s 823 shops (84.3 percent) were
still Jewish-owned. Five years later, although in absolute numbers there
were more Jewish shops – 710 out of a total of 999 (most of the increase
occurred in the food branch) – their relative proportion had declined to
71.1 percent. A few branches of commerce remained mainly in Jewish
hands: soap, salted fish, glass, iron, and building materials.<br><br><br>
<i>Industry.</i> Polish industry also suffered a sharp recession between the
wars, and here, too, the Jews, whether as industrialists or as workers,
were particularly hard hit. The combination of the monopoly system,
which was introduced in Poland at this time, and the nationalization of
large factories was calamitous for the Jews. One of the most flagrant
cases was the nationalization of the Shershevski tobacco factory, which,
before World War I, had been the third largest in all of Russia; its total
work force fell from 1,800 to 650, of whom only 280 were Jews.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Some of the city’s Jewish industrialists were nevertheless able to
maintain their position even in this period, continuing to do business
with non-Jews. For example, the construction company of Nahum
Freydovicz (cement-pipes factory and building-materials stores and
depots) continued to execute large-scale projects, such as barracks and
bridges, mainly for the army.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jewish factory workers were also victimized. As a rule, Jews were not
hired by state-owned factories, or by those that had been transferred to
the state in the monopolization process. Jews who were already working
in these plants, in some cases for many years, were the first to be
dismissed in every case of cutbacks. (Frequently they were sent on their
way with the words “Go to Palestine!”) This was the situation in the
matches, salt, and liquor industries. Even in those cases that they were
not fired, Jewish workers found it difficult to compete with their
non-Jewish colleagues: Many did not work on the Sabbath, and they
always felt pressure that in order to keep their jobs they had to excel.
<br><br><br>
<i>Crafts and Small Industry.</i> Under the circumstances described above, it is
not surprising that many of Grodno’s Jews were compelled to earn a
living as self-employed home-based workers, engaged primarily in
crafts and small industry. However, here again, there were many
difficulties. A law passed on June 27, 1927, obliged artisans to possess a
“master craftsman” certificate as a condition for maintaining a
workshop and employing apprentices. Yet only about 10 percent of
Jewish craftsmen had such a document. In order to obtain a permit, it
was necessary to pass a test conducted in Polish and pay a high fee. Nor
should we overlook the examiners’ hostility toward Jewish candidates.
The 1927 law applied also to pupils, who had to attend a vocational
school for three years and then specialize for three more years under a
“master craftsman.” However, there were few professional schools, and
Jews were not easily accepted.

</center>
In 1938, there were 1,146 artisans in Grodno, of whom 938 were
Jews. They were divided as follows: 364 tailors (of whom 322 were
Jews); 218 cobblers (168); 37 shoe stitchers (35); 80 ironmongers (68);
36 blacksmiths (19); 97 carpenters (83); 11 wagon-makers (6); 94 builders
(54); 69 glaziers (4); 12 harness-makers (2); 10 upholsterers (1); and 37
milliners (1). Some crafts remained virtually Jewish even in these difficult
times; these included pottery, tanning, engraving, and brush-making.
<br><br><br>
<i>Liberal Professions.</i> Although many of Grodno’s Jews were educated,
they were excluded from most of the relevant occupations, including
the government bureaucracy. A good number therefore turned to the
liberal professions, particularly medicine and law. However, the
government took measures to counter this trend by introducing a
numerus clausus system on the number of Jewish admissions to the
faculties of law, medicine, pharmacology, and so forth. As a result,
many young Jews went abroad to study. In the 1930s about half the
physicians and lawyers in Grodno were Jews (some fifty physicians and
forty lawyers, as well as a few engineers).
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The publications of the Endecja party called tirelessly for extreme
measures to be taken in order to oust the Jews from public service and
from the liberal professions. This demand was well received among
many Polish intellectuals. Finally an “Aryan clause” was imposed on
these professions, and the party published lists of physicians and
lawyers and distributed leaflets and posters urging Poles not to solicit
the services of Jewish practitioners. (“If you are sick, go only to a
Christian physician!”; “Seek counsel only from a Chris-tian
lawyer!”). In 1937, Endek students stepped up their vigils in front
of Jewish law firms and medical clinics.
<br><br><br>
<i>Banking.</i> Before World War I there were six private banks in Grodno,
all owned by Jews, as well as a Jewish savings fund and a low-interest
fund for the indigent. These institutions played a crucial role in the Jews’
economic life. There was no business, commercial enterprise, or factory
in Grodno that did not have contacts with Jewish bankers. Seventy-five
Jews (and their families) earned their living from banking. By the 1930s,
however, not one Jewish bank remained in the city, and there were only
two loan and savings funds, which employed twenty-two Jews between
them. The private banks were replaced by government banks – from
which Jews were rigorously excluded.<br><br>

</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Thus, on the whole, the economic depression in inter-war Poland and
its impact on commerce and business, in Grodno as throughout Poland,
severely affected the Jews. They gradually lost their sources of
livelihood, and unemployment among the Jewish population increased
relentlessly; yet in the late 1930s, in the private business sector, even
Jews without an income were forced to pay heavy taxes.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Few Jews benefited from the unemployment law of July 17, 1924, or
from statutory rights such as an annual vacation or a pension. In theory
this social legislation was not necessarily directed against Jews, but, in
practice, they overlaid a series of laws that directly affected the Jews,
because the benefits were granted to factories and workshops that
employed more than four workers and the Jews almost always owned
smaller workshops.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to a partial estimate, one-third of Poland’s Jews became
welfare and charity cases, one-third lived on the brink of poverty, and
the income and living standards of the rest also declined to some degree.<br><br>
