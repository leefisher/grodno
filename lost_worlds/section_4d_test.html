<h3>THE GERMAN OCCUPATION - 4</h3></center><br><br>
			<b>Liquidation of the Ghettos and the Deportations to the Camps
(November 2, 1942—March 12, 1942)</b><br><br>
In late 1942, exactly a year after Grodno’s Jews had been herded into
the ghettos, the Germans began making preparations for transporting
them to the death camps. In the winter of 1942/1943, when the
transports ceased elsewhere in Poland (in the <i>Generalgouvernement</i> and
in the <i>Warthegau</i>), it was the turn of the Jews in the Bialystok District.
There were about 130,000 Jews in 116 localities, including 35,000 in
nineteen locales in the Grodno subdistrict.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The officials responsible for the transports in the Grodno Subdistrict
were Heinz Errelis, the chief of the Gestapo in the city, and his deputy,
Erich Schott. To ensure that timing was coordinated throughout the
subdistrict, large forces were placed at their disposal from the Gestapo,
<i>Sipo</i> (Security Police), <i>Kripo</i> (Criminal Police), <i>Schupo</i>, gendarmerie, and
units of the local auxiliary police.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Transit camps, or as the Germans called them “Sammellagger,” which
were actually stations on the way to deportation to the death camps,
were set up at various sites in the Bialystok district. Probably the
Germans adopted this method because nearly all their means of
transportation were tied up at Stalingrad, where the battle raged. The
sites of the transit camps were chosen for their proximity to Jewish
places of residence – the barracks of the Tenth Battalion in Bialystok,
the Kielbasin camp next to Grodno, Bogusze, adjacent to Grajewo, a
temporary camp outside the city of Wolkowysk, and Zambrow camp ´
close by Lomza. From the transit camps the Jews were transported to ÿ
Auschwitz and Treblinka. Jews from the Bielsk-Podloski subdistrict, in
the southern part of the district, were sent directly to nearby Treblinka
without passing through a transit camp.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The horrific conditions in the transit camps – overcrowding, inhuman
living quarters, nonexistent sanitation, serious food shortages, bitter
cold, and unspeakable filth – were most conducive to illness and
epidemics. The mortality rate was high. Inmates were also subjected to
all manners of harassments, beatings, abuse, and even outright murder
by the staff and guards.
<i>Sealing off the Grodno Ghettos and the Onset of the Murders.</i> On November
2, 1942, Ghettos One and Two in Grodno were completely sealed off.
In the morning the workers from Ghetto Two were held up at the gate,
and suddenly the commandants of the two ghettos, Kurt Wiese (Ghetto
One) and Otto Streblow (Ghetto Two), appeared and began shooting
at the workers indiscriminately. Twelve Jews were killed, forty were
wounded, and the others fled wildly in panic. It was the first time that
Grodno’s Jews had experienced sudden mass murder, perpetrated
without warning. In the evening, the news spread through the city that
the Jews from the neighboring towns had been transported to the
Kielbasin camp.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
No one went out to work on the first day of the ghetto’s closure, but
from the next day until November 16, a small work force – those
employed by the Wehrmacht and the Gestapo – was allowed to leave.
However, for the first time they were kept under heavy guard.
<br><br><center>

</center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The sealing of the two ghettos was accompanied by show-hangings
and acts of group murder. The first hanging took place in the first half
of November 1942. The victims were Lena Prenska (the daughter of a
well-known tailor), and a refugee from Warsaw named Drucker – both
had been caught on the “Aryan” side of the city – and Moshe Spindler,
the superintendent of the apartment building in which Lena resided, for
not reporting her absence. The three were taken to a central site in the
ghetto and hanged in front of the Judenrat and other Jews who were
ordered to watch the “spectacle.” When Aharon Rubinczik, the head of
the Jewish Police, balked at tying the noose around the victims’ necks,
Wiese did it himself. The bodies were left on the gallows until the next
day as a warning to potential offenders.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This first hanging was widely publicized, but public executions
continued until the ghetto’s liquidation. Grodno survivors remember
well a group execution in February 1943, just before the city was
declared <i>Judenrein</i>.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Punitive executions were meted out not only for trying to escape. The
fate of anyone caught smuggling food into the ghetto was also sealed.
Shooting of Jews who were found carrying bread or other food became
routine. The Lipsky brothers were shot when they were caught trying
to smuggle in food in a cart. One died and the other was sent to a
concentration camp. Kimhe was shot to death for bringing in a chicken,
Zalman Goldschmid over a liter of milk – a few examples out of many.
<br><br>
<i>Evacuation of Ghetto Two.</i> About two weeks after the Jews in the
neighboring towns were taken to Kielbasin, the Germans began
liquidating Ghetto Two. First, however, they transferred those with
useful professions from Ghetto Two to Ghetto One. Errelis informed
the Judenrat in Ghetto One that Ghetto Two would soon be evacuated
but that Ghetto One would remain intact for the time being. All
“essential” Jews were moved from Ghetto Two to Ghetto One. On the
first day of the transfer, November 9, 1942, many Ghetto Two inmates
crowded around the gate in the hope of joining the fortunate individuals
who were being moved. The Germans fired into the crowd, killing
seven and wounding many others; the latter were prevented from

receiving medical aid. This demonstration of force had its effect: fewer
people congregated at the gate the next day. Still, on these two days
many did manage to steal across or use various ruses in order to enter
the supposedly “safer” Ghetto One. All told, some 4,000 professionals
and their families were transferred to Ghetto One.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first deportation from Ghetto Two took place on November 15,
1942. It was preceded by the publication of a notice listing the streets
that were to be evacuated and threatening execution for those who
spread false and misleading rumors. The Jews were told that they were
being sent to work, and, according to the testimony of Grodno survivors
who reached Bialystok in 1943, the Judenrat and the other Jews in the
ghetto believed this tale. Therefore, very few tried to hide. On the night
of the transport, the entrance to the ghetto and the road to the train
station were illuminated. Passenger and freight cars were in the station,
and both Wiese and Streblow were present.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The deportees reached Auschwitz on November 18, and before they
were murdered they were given prepared postcards on which a
sentence in German was printed: “Being treated well, we are working
and everything is fine.” They were ordered to sign the postcards and
address them to their relatives in Grodno.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first deportation was followed by a brief lull in Ghetto Two. But
a few days later, on November 21, everyone still in the ghetto was
deported to Auschwitz. Included in this transport were Jewish
policemen and members of the Ghetto Two Judenrat, including its
chairman.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There are various differences regarding the number of deportees.
Some sources mention 1,500-2,000 people in the first transport and
2,000-3,500 in the second. According to the records of Danuta Czech,<sup>11</sup>
the first transport contained 1,000 Jews, of whom 165 men and 65
women were selected for work. Everyone else went straight to their
death. The second transport, which reached Auschwitz on November
25, contained 2,000 Jews; of these, 305 men and 128 women were
selected for work; again, all the others were murdered immediately.
Probably at least 4,000 inhabitants of the ghetto – those remaining in
Ghetto Two after the transfer of a similar number of Jews to Ghetto One
– perished in Auschwitz. With the liquidation of the ghetto, a few dozen
more Jews were discovered; they were transferred to the Kielbasin
camp (see below).<ul>
<hr width="85%"><font size="1"><sup>11</sup> Danuta Czech, <i>Kalendarium der Ereignisse im Konzentrationslager Auschwitz-Birkenau</i>,
Rowohlt, 1989, pp. 336-337, 348, 354.</font><br><hr width="85%"></ul><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the liquidation of Ghetto Two in Grodno and of the smaller
ghettos in the vicinity, German officials warned about the projected
economic consequences of eliminating the Jewish work force,
particularly in the crafts, which had nearly all been in Jewish hands.
However, once the decision to annihilate all the Jews had been made,
economic considerations became unimportant; the head of the
subdistrict tried to reassure the military elements who needed the ghetto
workshops that the Judenaktion would have only a minor impact on the
economy. Concurrently, the Germans readied themselves to train
substitute manpower in the crafts.
<br><br>
<i>Evacuation of Ghetto One.</i> The deportations from Ghetto One began at
the end of November 1942, following the opening of the Kielbasin
transit camp; they followed a different pattern from previous <i>Aktionen</i>
in the region’s ghettos and in Ghetto Two at Grodno. All told, about
4,000 Jews from Ghetto One were sent to Kielbasin in two transports.
Later on they were deported from Kielbasin to Auschwitz and
Treblinka. In January and February 1943, most of those who remained
in Ghetto One were deported directly to Auschwitz and Treblinka, and
the few remaining Jews in Ghetto One were transferred to the Bialystok
ghetto in March 1943.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The first <i>Aktion</i> in Ghetto One (the third in Grodno) took place in late
November 1942. In the dead of night, men, women, and children were
removed from their apartments and concentrated in the Great
Synagogue. Toward morning Wiese and Streblow arrived, ordered the
Jews out of the synagogue, and began to march them to Kielbasin, all
the while beating them. At the front of the column marched a respected
Jew, Skibelski. The Germans forced him to wear a clown’s hat, dance
and play the fiddle. He led the march, while everyone else was made to
sing, in Yiddish, “Yiddl Mit’n Fiddl.”<sup>12</sup><ul>
<hr width="85%"><font size="1"><sup>12</sup> Zandman, op. cit., pp. 70-71.</font>
<hr width="85%"></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the transport that arrived in Kielbasin at the beginning of
December 1942, were also the head of the Jewish Police, Aharon
Rubinczik, and the lawyer and Judenrat member Izaak Gozhanski.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The deportation lists were prepared by the Judenrat, and the Jewish
Police had to round up the deportees. By mistake, some of those from
the workshops were also added to the list, but they were released at the
intervention of the Jewish liaison representatives and were sent back to
Grodno.<br><br>
<font size="+1">The Kielbasin Camp</font><br><br>
Kielbasin, formerly the farm of a Polish squire, lay 5 kilometers from
Grodno, on the road to Kuznica. In the 1930s the farm had been used
to train members of He-Halutz ha-Mizrachi prior to their settling in
Palestine, but the Soviet authorities expropriated the farm and made it
a station for agricultural machinery. The Germans converted it into a
prison camp. The camp was 1 square kilometer, and it was surrounded
by a double barbed-wire fence, with a guard tower at every corner. By
the autumn of 1942, there were no more prisoners in the camp. It then
became a concentration camp for Jews from Grodno and from the
surrounding towns – Druskieniki, Skidel, Porzecze, Jeziory,
Sopockinie, Lunna, Ostryna, Brzostowica Wielka, Dombrowa, Janow,
Nowy Dwor, Suchowola, Sokolka, Amdur, Kuznica, Korycin, Krynki,
Sidra, and Odelsk. Based on the number of Jews who were in the
ghettos until the deportation, we may estimate the number of deportees
to Kielbasin as at least 35,000. The number of inmates in the camp
fluctuated because of the transports to the death camps and because the
transfer of Jews from Grodno to Kielbasin was carried out in groups and
over a period of months.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
When a new batch of inmates arrived at the camp, the German police
would stage a scene of chaos and in the disorder would beat and rob the
women. The men were also beaten with particular savagery, and the
horses were flogged until they galloped away with the carts carrying the
Jews’ bundles, most of which they had not managed to unload.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Survivors of the camp remember its commandant, a Rumanian-born
German named Karl Rinzler who could speak Yiddish mixed with
German, for his extraordinary brutality. Almost always inebriated, he
would take inmates from their huts and shoot them publicly for his
amusement. When Rinzler made an appearance in the camp, the Jews
tried to stay in their barracks so as not to be seen outside. In the
morning, upon entering the camp, he called over every Jew he
encountered (women especially) and beat them with a heavy rubber
club that had a small metal ball attached to its end until it was drenched
in blood. He stalked the camp like a wild animal. His brutality took
different forms. Thus he could kill someone in the kitchen for not
working, or savagely beat a Jew who did not remove his hat properly
out of respect.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Twice a day, in the morning and early afternoon, the Jews had to line
up to be counted. If the count went awry or a search had to be made for
missing people, they might stand outside for hours. Following this,
Rinzler made the inmates run for an hour on the parade ground while
they sang in Yiddish. On one such occasion a youngster aged about
eighteen arrived late; Rinzler stood him in the center of the grounds and
in front of everyone shot him in the head.
The Germans set up a Judenrat in Kielbasin made up of represen-tatives
of the communities’ Judenrats. Its chairman, Leib Fraenkel from
Druskieniki, was the liaison with the camp commandant. His deputy
was Marik from Nowy Dwor, and other members were Meir Kaplan
from Krynki, the lawyer Friedberg from Sokolka, the teacher Guttman
from Indura, and Berl Grawinski from Dombrowa. Their tasks included
preparing a card-file of all the Jews in the camp, distributing food to the
inmates, and organizing the transports. Every day the members of the
Judenrat had to appear before Rinzler, who usually flogged them. There
was also a Jewish Police in the camp, which was entrusted with keeping
order and guarding the foodstuffs. The Jewish policemen had no police
powers.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Kielbasin inmates lived in a sort of baracks, Ziemlankas, as the
camp’s inhabitants called them, 50 to 100 meters long, 6 to 8 meters
wide, and about 2 meters high (the floor was half a meter deep under
the ground). They were the products of the prisoners’ labor during the
camp’s previous incarnation. There were six blocs of these barracks,
which were separated from one another by barbed-wire fences. A bloc
consisted of fourteen barracks, each of which held at least 250 or 300
inmates (about 500, according to Errelis). These barracks were
populated by towns: each town was allotted one or more barracks on
the basis of its Jewish population.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The floor in these Ziemlankas was plain earth padded at the bottom
with branches and covered with straw. On entering one had to step
down five or six steps. Inside there were double shelves/bunks which
served for sleeping. Those in the bottom row could sit but not stand up.
Those on top had the roof immediately above them and had to crawl in
order to lie down. The boards were dirty, and water leaked in from the
roof. Men, women, and children lived together in each Ziemlanka, and
also shared the toilet – an open pit, for men and women together. The
overcrowding, the bitter cold, the rain that leaked in, and the filth and
lice turned these accommodations into a living hell. The camp had
running water, but Jews were forbidden to go near the taps. It was not
uncommon for inmates to be flogged to death for stealing water.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Hunger was a permanent fixture at Kielbasin. Food rations consisted
of soup with a few unpeeled potatoes or scraps of rotten cauliflower
cooked in water and 100 to 150 grams of bread per person – though
even that miserly bread portion was not distributed every day. Two
weeks after the camp was opened, the Jewish representation asked the
Grodno ghetto for assistance, and the Judenrat there responded by
sending about 200 grams of bread per person every day. Some
fortunate inmates received packages from Grodno, and some were able
to pay Jewish wagoners from Grodno in dollars for bread. Others
brought with them dried foods such as legumes, beans, lentils, and
cereals, and cooked them in the Ziemlanka over a fire they made with
planks stripped from the walls. But if caught, they were punished; they
were beaten and deprived of their bread ration.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The hunger, overcrowding, dirt, and lice resulted in lethal epidemics
that claimed many victims – seventy a day, on the average. The ill were
transferred to separate Ziemlankas and treated by Jewish physicians and
nurses who were also incarcerated at Kielbasin. The Germans kept their
distance from the makeshift “hospital” for fear of becoming infected.
However, neither the high mortality rate nor the transports to
Treblinka and Auschwitz emptied out Kielbasin camp, as it was
replenished with the transport from Grodno. But Kielbasin was only a
transit camp. A week after the first Jews were incarcerated there, the
transports to Auschwitz began. The order to begin the transports was
issued by the Reich Main Security Office (RSHA) to Wilhelm Altenloh,
who relayed it, first by telephone and then in writing, to Errelis and to
the Gestapo’s external station at Grodno.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
To keep the Judenrat off guard, Rinzler informed the representatives
that because of the cold winter weather and the high incidence of illness,
the Jewish inmates would be moved to another location where they
would work and enjoy better conditions. The Jews of Skidel, who were
the first to arrive at Kielbasin, were also the first to be transported. A
few days after their departure, Rinzler showed the remaining inmates
letters from the deportees in which they described their fine new
conditions. Together with the letters each inmate received 50 grams of
sausage. Many Jews wanted fervently to believe the Germans, but some
were suspicious. As Zalman Gradowski wrote:<ul>

<i>My friend, we have just had some terrible news. My family and I,
my friends and acquaintances, and thousands more Jews are
forced to prepare to leave. Many horrific thoughts race through
my mind. Who knows where we are being taken, who knows what
tomorrow holds for us? A feeling of dread gives us no respite,
because the authorities’ behavior conflicts with their declared
goal. If they want us to serve as a work force, why do they wear us
down so harshly, why do they suck our blood? Why do firm
Jewish muscles become flaccid and turn into feeble hands? Why
do they eliminate vital places of work, which without us remain
dead, motionless, yet no one cares? Why are the public works,
which even in a place of concentration are essential and as needed
as life – why are they superfluous here, useless, and dispensable,
why? Or is it really just the deception of trained, despicable
criminals who intend to anesthetize us with the chloroform of
work in order to facilitate the great annihilation? These reflections
obsess me now, before the Jews embark on their journey</i>.<sup>13</sup>

Megillah (Hebrew), Tel Aviv, 1978, p. 187.
</font><hr width=85%></ul>
Before each transport the Jews were ordered to turn over all their
remaining money, gold, and jewelry. The transports took place in the
dead of night, and were not postponed by storms or bitter cold. The
police and personnel of Sipo and the SD read out the names of the
towns; their former inhabitants were then concentrated in the center of
the camp and made to march to the train station at Lososna. The elderly
and infirm who were unable to keep up with the march were shot on the
spot. At the station the Jews were packed into freight cars for their final
journey.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In December 1942, a severe shortage of railway cars forced the
Germans to suspend temporarily transports to Auschwitz from the
Bialystok district ghettos and from Kielbasin. Instead, however, they
stepped up the transports to Treblinka, which was relatively close.<br><br>
<i>Attempts at Flight and Revolt in Kielbasin and on the Transports.</i> A few dozen
Kielbasin inmates managed to escape, usually in food wagons that came
and went from the camp (among them Felix Zandman), or in wagons
that took the remnants of the Jews’ belongings to Grodno. During one
such escape attempt sixteen-year-old Rivka Freydovicz was shot in the
head by Rinzler in front of a group of people, because she tried to take
the place of someone else who was on the list to return to Grodno.<sup>14</sup><ul>
<hr width=85%><font size=1><sup>14</sup>Zandman, op. cit., pp. 66-67.</font>
<hr width=85%></ul>
Others tried to evade the transports by hiding in abandoned
Ziemlankas. Some were discovered and shot immediately. About 600
Grodno Jews hid in bunks that housed inhabitants of other towns that
had not yet been designated for transport.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On one of the transports, in December 1942, from Kielbasin to
Auschwitz, an uprising broke out. The train arrived at Treblinka in the
evening, when most of the Jewish inmates were already locked in their
quarters, and the Germans and Ukrainians had to handle the victims
themselves. One testimony describes what then transpired:<ul>
<i>Suddenly we heard shouts and shooting... We waited impatiently
for morning to find out what had happened... [and the following
day] the field was strewn with dead bodies and next to them the
instruments with which they had defended themselves...</i></ul>
It emerged that most of the Jews on the transport, which included
children, women, and young people, had obeyed the order to undress
and enter the “showers” (gas chambers); but those who came out of the
cars last understood the situation.<ul>
<i>The redness of the conflagration, the barbed-wire fences, the
guard towers – everything that could be seen in darkness
illuminated by flames – provoked them to rebel.</i></ul>
Instead of stripping they stormed the SS men with almost their bare
hands:<ul>
<i>It was a furious battle. The Jews defended themselves with the
strength of despair. Lacking weapons, they attacked the Germans
with bottles.</i></ul>
Some of the young people fled in all directions inside the camp, and
some actually reached the quarters of the Jewish inmates, where they
tried to hide. However, Germans, Ukrainians, and Kapo personnel
rooted them out brutally, also beating and flogging the veteran
prisoners. About twenty of the youngsters were caught and shot. The
others were found in various places in the camp; those who resisted
were shot on the spot and the others were dragged to the gas chambers.
“By dawn it was all over.” Three SS men who were critically injured
were taken to a nearby hospital.<sup>15</sup><ul>
<hr width=85%><font size=1><sup>15</sup> Yankel Wiernik, <i>A Year In Treblinka</i>, New York, 1944, p. 30.
</font><hr width=85%></ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uprising was spontaneous, since conditions at Kielbasin ruled
out any ability to organize. Some of the young people on the transport
had taken with them tools and knives for later use in the hope that they
would be able to leap out of the train (as some of their comrades from
Grodno would do in early 1943), and these served them as weapons.<br><br>
<i>The Liquidation of the Kielbasin Camp and the Return of the Survivors to
Grodno.</i> Toward the end of December 1942, when the transports from
Kielbasin were suspended completely due to the shortage of train cars,
the Germans decided to liquidate the camp. The last of the Jews there,
2,000–3,000, from Druskieniki, Suchowola, and Grodno (as well as
those who had avoided the earlier transports by hiding) were made to
walk back to Ghetto One in Grodno. Again a Jew playing a fiddle was
placed at the head of the column, and the others were forced to sing as
they marched. Only the elderly and the ill were carried in carts. When
they arrived – frozen, bruised, and bloodied – at the Grodno ghetto, the
returnees received assistance from the Judenrat and were put up
temporarily in the Great Synagogue until places for them could be
found in private homes.<br><br>
<b>Deportation to the Death Camps</b>
<i>The January Deportation from Grodno (</i>“Aktion <i>of the Ten Thousand”)</i>. The
respite in the deportations from the Bialystok district lasted about a
month, from mid-December 1942 until mid-January 1943, but even
then the Germans made plans to resume the implementation of the
“Final Solution” in the region.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On December 16, 1942, Gestapo Chief Mueller sent a cable to the
head of the SS, Himmler, describing the program to renew the
deportations to Auschwitz beginning on January 11, 1943. Among the
45,000 Jews who were designated for deportation in this wave were
30,000 from the Bialystok area, 10,000 from Theresienstadt, 3,000 from
Holland, and 2,000 from Berlin. Of them, 15,000 of the most fit were to
be selected for forced labor in Auschwitz; all the rest would be
murdered.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The 30,000 from the Bialystok district who were mentioned in
Mueller’s cable – which really amounted to an order for the general
evacuation of the Jews from the Greater Reich – were the last in the
area. Beside the city of Bialystok itself, they were from Grodno,
Sokolka, Krynki, Pruzhana, and Jashiniowka.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On January 18, 1943, those designated for deportation received an
official notice stating that they were being sent to forced labor in
armament factories. That evening the ghetto’s gates were sealed for five
days (until January 22), and the Jews were not allowed out. The
manhunt began. More than 10,000 people were rounded up and herded
into the Great Synagogue. The Jewish police, under Gestapo
supervision, removed people from their homes and searched out those
Jews who had gone into hiding.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The German factories outside the ghetto were ordered to send their
Jewish workers back to the ghetto immediately. Some factory managers
and German officials both in the ghetto and outside tried to stand up for
their Jewish workers, or at least for the essential workers among them,
but to no avail. There was no certificate that could protect its holder;
everything was sudden and arbitrary.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Gestapo intervened in the work of the Judenrat and introduced
changes in its structure, reducing the number of council officials, and
appointing new ones as it saw fit. Only 2,700 people – the members of
the Judenrat, the Jewish Police, hospital staff, workers in the felt factory,
and craftsmen who produced goods for the Germans – were separated
from the other ghetto inhabitants and permitted to remain in Grodno.
Many Jews went into hiding. This caused a discrepancy of 1,500
people, and so others were seized arbitrarily in order to fill the
deportation quota. The police, fearing that the Germans would make
good on their threat to place them on the transport in order to meet the
quota, redoubled their efforts. Indeed, the last transport was 400 people
above the quota, but the “extra” Jews were also taken to the death train
with the rest. (In contrast to this harsh description, there are also
testimonies about police who saved relatives and acquaintances and
some who refused to act as informers.)
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The deportees were marched to the train station at Lososna; only the
elderly, the sick, and the children were transported there by wagon or
truck. Guards were present in large numbers, shooting those who could
not keep up. At the train station the deportees were shoved and pushed
on top of each other into cattle cars; the doors were closed and sealed;
and they set off on their final journey.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the January<i> Aktion</i> there were two attempts at resistance. Two
young Jews tried to assassinate Streblow but were themselves shot to
death (for details, see the chapter on the youth movements’
underground). And youth-movement members tried to stir up a melee
in the synagogue so to enable a mass escape – but only a few managed
to get away.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
After the <i>Aktion</i>, a large number of bullet-ridden dead bodies remained
strewn around the Great Synagogue, as well as in houses and on the
streets. For a full week bodies lay in public places in the ghetto, until the
Germans allowed them to be buried.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the January 1943 <i>Aktion</i>, 11,650 Jews were deported from
Grodno to Auschwitz. Of them, 9,851 were murdered as soon as they
arrived at the extermination camp, while 1,799 (1,096 men and 703
women) were selected for forced labor.<sup>16</sup><ul>

<i>The February Aktion (The “5,000 Aktion”) and the Murder of Dr. Brawer.</i>
Following the “Aktion of the Ten Thousand,” approximately 5,000 Jews
remained in the ghetto, about half of them “illegals” without papers.
The Germans expropriated entire streets from the ghetto for the benefit
of Grodno. At the same time, the authorities improved the food supply,
increasing the daily ration per person to between 400 and 600 grams of
bread and adding items that had previously not been available or had
been distributed in minuscule amounts, such as sausage and cigarettes.
The level of the meals in the Judenrat-run kitchen improved. More
important, the Germans assured the Judenrat that there would be no
further deportations. The workers resumed their work in the ghetto and
outside, the scrutiny at the gate stopped, and something of a calm
atmosphere prevailed. True, Wiese continued to enter the ghetto and
shoot people for his amusement; but the illusion of stability and the
difficulty of finding a place to hide outside the ghetto combined to
dissuade many from trying to escape. Indeed, some of those who had
fled now returned.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, the ostensible calm did not last for long. On February 11,
1943, the Judenrat announced that the Jews were being sent “to new
places of work.” Two days later, on February 13, a few hundred Jews
were taken to work outside the ghetto, mainly in the Gestapo
headquarters and the Royal Hotel. A few hours after their departure,
the ghetto was closed and a new Aktion for deportation started. Wiese,
Streblow, and their henchmen appeared at the ghetto gates, where
hundreds of Jews were assembled in the hope that they would be taken
to work, and began shooting into the crowd. The Jews were then made
to line up in formations of five and were marched to the synagogue.
Some managed to flee, others were shot in the attempt. In the early
afternoon the outside workers were also brought back to the ghetto.
Most of them were taken to the synagogue and later deported; the rest
were left in the ghetto as specialists and brought to the Judenrat
building, which served as a haven for essential workers and for Jewish
policemen and their families. Another safe place was the felt factory,
where the workers were joined by their colleagues from the starch
factory. The wives of the outside workers, believing that their husbands’
work assignments would protect them, did not try to hide and were
seized together with their children. The hospital’s medical staff was also
brought to the synagogue in the evening; some personnel were later
taken back to the hospital, the rest became part of the transport.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The members of the Judenrat and its clerks, led by Brawer, were also
herded into the synagogue. At around dusk Brawer was called outside,
where Wiese shot him after discovering that Shulkes and Bass, two
“Farbindungsmen” (liason-men) of the Judenrat, had fled from the ghetto.
A third “Farbindungsman,” Sarnacki, was also shot for the same reason.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
During the selection of essential workers, Sender Freydovicz tried to
move over from the line of people destined for deportation to the other
line, of those who were supposed to stay. Wiese saw him, told him to
turn around, and lifted his gun in order to execute him. Freydovicz
started running. Even though Wiese was shooting at him with a
machine-gun, he succeeded to escape.<sup>17</sup>
<ul><hr width=85%><font size=1><sup>17</sup> Zandman, op. cit., p. 90.</font><hr width=85%></ul>
A few youngsters again tried to break down the doors and windows in
the synagogue and escape. One of them managed to get outside, but
was seized by a Jewish policeman and brought back in. His friends
removed the door of the lavatory from its hinges and fled. Wiese
opened fire, hitting about ten of them. A few Jews hid inside the
synagogue itself. At 10 P.M. the manhunt was called off, and during the
night the detainees were made to march, in formations of five, to the
Lososna train station. On the way there were more escape attempts.
Some were shot to death, but a few dozen did succeed in getting away.
The transport left Lososna at 5:40 A.M. and reached Treblinka at ten
minutes past noon.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Two days later the manhunt resumed. The deceptive promises of the
Germans lolled the Jews into a false sense of security and they made no
attempt to hide. This made it very easy for them to be rounded up. Only
the Jews who worked for the Gestapo were permitted to remain in
Grodno; all the others, even the most essential and those who worked
for the Wehrmacht, were added to the transport. A few workers from
the felt factory outside the ghetto managed to escape. This time those
from the hospital staff who had been released only two days earlier were
also put on the transport. All were force-marched to the train station
during the night and were taken to Treblinka.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the final day of the <i>Aktion</i>, February 16, 1943, Jewish policemen
went through the streets announcing that anyone caught outside would
be shot, but that no harm would come to those who assembled at the
synagogue. This time, though, skepticism prevailed and no one came
forward. That afternoon the Germans released 200 Jews who were
already massed in the synagogue and declared the Aktion over. Jews
emerged from their hiding places and were greeted by the sight of
bodies in the streets. There was a pool of blood in front of the synagogue
and many bodies inside, as well as piles of blood-drenched clothing and
shreds of torn Torah scrolls. More than 100 Jews were murdered that
day in the ghetto.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the February Aktion more than 4,000 Jews were sent to Treblinka
in two transports – 2,500 in the first and 1,600 in the second – of whom
150 were selected for forced labor.
<br><br>
<i>Criticism of Grodno Survivors Regarding the Behavior of the Judenrat and the
Jewish Police.</i> In the first year of the ghetto’s existence, the Judenrat did
its best to assist the inhabitants economically as well as with housing and
health care. Dr. Brawer, the head of the Judenrat, was known as an
educated, decent person and had gained respect among the Jews as well
as the German authorities. By bribing and cajoling the authorities he
succeeded from time to time to obtain various benefits for the ghetto.
However, after the liquidation of Ghetto Two, in November 1942,
Brawer lost his status with the authorities. When finally Brawer
presented himself to the Germans, they “honored” him with slaps
across his face and by making him a laughing stock. In December 1942,
Errelis ordered him and other Judenrat members to “shovel” snow from
the street with teaspoons; on another occasion, he ordered Brawer to
put on a black suit and a top hat and to march atop a barrel filled with
excrement.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Many of the Grodno Jews who arrived in Bialystok in March 1943
accused the Judenrat of deceiving the public and reducing the Jews’
chances of survival. Others claimed that the Judenrat was not to blame
and that it had no alternative but to urge the Jews to report for the
transports. It is clear, at any rate, that enormous pressure was brought
to bear on the Judenrat when transports were about to be carried out.
The Judenrat was compelled to prepare lists of names, transfer Jews
from one ghetto to another, and declare that the deportees were,
supposedly, being sent to places of work. Some say, though, that in
private talks Judenrat members did not try to calm anyone; on the
contrary, they told the truth. Indeed, the Jews of Grodno had heard
about Auschwitz and Treblinka, and there were unmistakable signs of
the Germans’ intention to make Grodno Judenrein. The Grodno
Judenrat, like many others, apparently subscribed to the theory of
“survival through work”; that is, it tried to maintain the ghetto’s
existence until normalcy could be restored, based on the belief that the
Germans would be defeated one day, and that at least some Jews could
be saved – the workers and their families. Brawer is said to have
believed sincerely in the Germans’ promises, at least until the February
Aktion. But by then, when he urged the Jews to act on their own and try
to survive, only a few remained.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Once the transports began, the Judenrat’s activity was almost
completely suspended; the Germans intervened in its every move and
replaced some of its members. In January 1943, the Gestapo demanded
the funds of the Judenrat’s finance committee and, shortly afterward,
also confiscated the archives of the statistics’ department. The result,
effectively, was the liquidation of the Judenrat together with the entire
ghetto. In the final stage only the liaison personnel to the Gestapo, the
burial society, and the food department were left and continued to
function partially. The Judenrat’s presidium and its large apparatus
were voided of content and their tasks were transferred to others,
mainly to the personnel of the Jewish Police. Following Brawer’s
murder the Gestapo ordered a new Judenrat to be established under the
leadership of Noah Srebernik, who, after the dismisal of Rubinczik and
his deportation to Kielbasin, was nominated as chief of the Jewish Police.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Very severe criticism of the Jewish Police was lodged by the survivors
of the Grodno ghetto for their attempt to save themselves by fulfilling
their duties in a most meticulous manner. Only a few policemen
refrained from collaborating with the Germans, and some of them were
able to save Jews, mainly relatives and acquaintances, during the
January Aktion.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
However, by the time of the February Aktion there was a clear change
in the behavior of the Jewish Police: despite the heavy pressure and the
threats, they refused to inform or to collaborate with the Germans.
Many only went through the motions of doing their duty. Even when
they climbed up into attics looking for Jews they did not carry out a
full-fledged search but made do with calling out the coded message,
“Jews must come out of their hiding places because Grodno shall
become Judenrein,” so that those in hiding should understand that they
should remain where they were. According to witnesses, this time the
policemen understood that they would not escape the fate of their
brethren and therefore refrained from burdening their consciences with
additional injustices.<ul>
<i>They grasped that this time the intention was to vacate Grodno
finally of all Jews. The members of the Judenrat were taken, as
were the workers in the felt factory, which was so important to the
Wehrmacht. What, then, assures them that they will be spared?
Why should they again help the enemy in the last extermination
operation? Why should they go on tainting their name?</i><sup>18</sup><br>
<hr width=85%><font size=1><sup>18</sup> “The Tragedy of Grodnoer Jews” (Yiddish), March 1943, Yad Vashem Archives,
M-11/30, p. 14.</font><hr width=85%></ul>
According to one testimony, even during the February Aktion some
policemen uncovered hiding places and turned in Jews to the Germans.
Some accepted bribes to hide people and informed on those who could
not pay. Yet such behavior still appears to have been marginal in
February, and perhaps the brutality of the police in the January Aktion
was so overpowering that it overshadowed the changed attitude of the
police in February.<br><br>
<i>The Jews’ Reaction.</i> What did the ghetto inhabitants know about events
outside Grodno and about the fate of the deportees? Beginning in late
1941 and during 1942, Grodno was visited by emissaries from Vilna
and by Jews who had witnessed the extermination at Slonim. But the
information they provided reached only limited circles, mainly the
underground groups. In November 1942, the Jews in Grodno did not
yet have a clear picture of the situation, and it was only after the
evacuation of Ghetto Two that rumors about the mass annihilation of
Jews began to trickle in. The information was often conveyed by Poles
who worked with Jews outside the ghetto; but even then only a few were
inclined to believe the rumors. In general, the Jews in Grodno lacked
solid information about the destination of the transports. The strongest
evidence of this was that even during the liquidation of Ghetto One
many still believed that they were being sent to work, and the postcards
that arrived from the deportees reinforced these illusions.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On the other hand, many Jews had forebodings and tried to ready
themselves for future developments by preparing hiding places in
cellars, attics, behind double walls, and the like. There were also more
escapes, particularly during and after the February Aktion. Desperation
encouraged boldness, and the threat of being executed no longer
deterred would-be escapees.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A number of ghetto residents, particularly among the intelligentsia,
took their own lives during the January Aktion. One of these was Arieh
Marder, director of the Judenrat’s statistics’ department. Two months
earlier he had resigned after learning that the Germans intended to
make use of his data for their extermination operations.
<br><br>
<i>Survivors of the February Aktion: “Legal” and “Illegal” Jews.</i> After the two
mass Aktionen, more than 1,000 Jews still remained in Ghetto One,
concentrated in several buildings between the synagogue and
Zamkowa Street. About half of them were essential workers, the
“legals”, while the rest were in hiding and so-called “illegals.” The first
group, who had “life certificates,” included about 120 hospitalized
typhus victims, twenty-five hospital staff, twenty-five workers in the
Judenrat’s kitchen, three directors of Judenrat workshops, twenty-seven
policemen and their families (sixty to seventy people), and two
carpenters who worked for the Gestapo.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There was a chronic shortage of food in the ghetto; at the same time,
anyone caught smuggling in food faced certain death. A small box of
saccharine cost 33 marks in the Grodno ghetto (7 marks in Bialystok),
a kilogram of butter sold for about 600 marks, and a kilo of pork went
for 400 marks or more. A successful smuggling transaction conducted
outside the ghetto (feigerl ) could produce a large profit of up to 1,000
marks. At these prices there were even some “illegals” who risked their
lives and stole out of the ghetto without a yellow patch (a double risk)
in order to smuggle goods.<br><br>

</center>


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Still, the amount of food available to the “legals,” and especially those
who worked for the Gestapo, improved in comparison with the
previous period: they received 1 kilogram of bread per person daily for
themselves and their families, as well as quite a reasonable lunch from
a special kitchen. Gestapo personnel supplied their workers, at their
own initiative, with bread, meat, butter, and the like. At the same time,
the “illegals” who remained in the shrunken ghetto also benefited from
better living conditons: they lived in houses, could venture out into the
street fairly easily and obtain food, and were the recipients of food from
their “legal” brethren. The solidarity that prevailed among the Jews in
the Grodno ghetto after the February Aktion became a byword and was
talked about even in Bialystok.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Those who were in hiding outside the shrunken ghetto were in a far
more perilous situation. Peasants from the surrounding villages moved
into buildings on streets that had been emptied of Jews and removed
from the ghetto. They could turn in Jews who were in hiding, as the
latter occasionally had to make their way out into the shrunken ghetto
in order to wash and scavenge for food. Few Christians were willing to
risk giving shelter to Jews, and most of the Jews who escaped were
robbed and handed over to the Germans. And yet there were a few
Christians who risked their lives in order to help Jews.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Jews who tried to escape were shot to death. Wiese usually ordered
their bullet-riddled bodies to be left in public view until dusk as a
warning. Many of those who fled returned to the ghetto when they were
unable to find a place to hide or to join the partisans; yet at the same
time escapes from the ghetto continued.
<br><br>
<i>Transfer of Grodno’s Last Jews to Bialystok.</i> Following the February <i>Aktion</i>,
the last Jews in Grodno sensed that another, final, <i>Aktion</i> was only a
matter of days. One evening a few vehicles entered the ghetto; these
transported the last members of the Judenrat – Feinstein, Efron, and
Lifszic – to Bialystok. Clearly liquidation of the ghetto was imminent.
Dozens of youngsters now tried to reach Bialystok by every possible
means.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On March 11, 1943, tension in the ghetto rose to a fever pitch. The
next day everyone was ordered into the synagogue. This time, though,
the Jews did not believe Wiese’s assurances that they were being moved
to Bialystok. Most were certain that their destination was Treblinka.
Nevertheless, they remained quiet and behaved with decorum, taking
care not to anger Wiese. However, before the transport left, Wiese shot
about thirty patients who remained in the hospital. With no one to bury
them, their bodies were thrown into a pit, which was then filled in with
earth by the use of grenades. Then the assembled Jews, 1,148 people,
were force-marched from the synagogue to the train station and
crammed into freight cars, about 110 to each car. A few youngsters tried
to jump out, but with little success.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
About half of those in the transport were “legals” – ghetto policemen,
hospital staff, craftsmen who worked for the Gestapo – and their
families. They were joined by many “illegals,” but some of the latter
remained in hiding, either because they were suspicious about the
destination of this transport or because they were unaware of it.
When the train arrived at Bialystok, the railway cars were opened.
The Jews had to form in threes and were marched to the ghetto; only
now did they believe that their destination was the Bialystok ghetto and
not an extermination camp.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Immediately upon their arrival, the Grodno deportees were taken to
register at the police station and were deloused, because “without the
confirmation of the bath house no one will receive a permit for an
apartment and for supplies.” Most of the new arrivals, and particularly
the “illegals,” had absolutely nothing, and the Bialystok Judenrat helped
them obtain clothing and basic furniture.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It was said that the Grodno policemen had the effrontery to demand
that they be co-opted to the local police force and that the Grodno
functionaries wanted autonomy – their own Judenrat or representation
on the local Judenrat, accommodations together in the ghetto, and their
own police unit. However, the Bialystok Jundenrat strongly rejected all
these demands. Work was arranged for some of the Grodno Jews in
Bialystok, in some cases for the Gestapo; the Gestapo sent twelve of
them to work outside the ghetto, to which they were returned at the end
of the week. Gestapo workers received good lunches, could purchase
expensive food, and benefited from other privileges. For example, they
were permitted to wander about outside the ghetto and purchase
various items there.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Grodno Jews shared the life and the fate of their brethren in the
Bialystok ghetto. Some of them joined the Bialystok underground and
took part in the insurrection of August 1943. Almost none survived.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The Grodno evacuees took only small bundles with them: a little
food, clothing, and underclothing. Most of their property – furniture,
clothing, dishes, cutlery, and valuables – remained in their homes, and
the authorities sold it for next to nothing. In short order the Jews’ homes
were emptied. Only a small part of the former ghetto was populated by
peasants. This then was the demise of the Jewish community of Grodno.
<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
On March 13, 1943, posters were put up on the city’s streets
announcing that Grodno was <i>Judenrein</i>.<br><br>
