          </b></font></p><a name="top"></a>
        <p>The Bialystok trial in Bielefeld is remarkable in several 
aspects. 
          Only in a few cases were deportations of Jews subject to 
prosecution 
          in the Federal Republic. Frederic Christiaan RÅter, a professor 
at the 
          Institute for Criminal Law at the University of Amsterdam, has 
been 
          documenting over the last forty years all decisions made by West 
German 
          law courts concerning Nazi murder cases. Accordingly, the German 
justice 
          system dealt with the deportation of Jews only in 19 
proceedings, 13 
          in West and 6 in East Germany. Fifteen people were convicted 
altogether. 
          Nine convictions by West-German law courts are juxtaposed to 38 
acquittals.<a href="#177"><sup>177</sup></a> 
          The first Bialystok trial in Bielefeld against Dr. Zimmermann, 
but also 
          many other Nazi court proceedings show, that the evidence of 
intention 
          could by no means be provided only by testimonies. The Bielefeld 
verdict 
          of April 14, 1967 emphasizes that the great expenditure of 
investigation 
          in order to proof intention was well above average. In this case 
the 
          determination of knowledge that the defendant had, concerning 
what destiny 
          awaited the Jews, was crucial. More than 1000 documents were 
included 
          in the evidence as proof of the actions. More and more new 
documents 
          were introduced during the trial and the list of witnesses was 
extended 
          continuously. When Dr. Gaebert says, "I was acting as a 
historian during 
          the trial"<a href="#178"><sup>178</sup></a> he confirms the need 
for 
          further investigations during the trial. One consequence was the 
prolongation 
          of the trial, which lasted altogether about a year.</p>
        <p>The accomplishments of the court must also be seen in the 
context of 
          the state of research of German historiography in the 1960s, 
regarding 
          the Nazi persecution and killing of European Jews. In the first 
scientific 
          overall portrayal of the Nazi regime, "The German Dictatorship" 
by Karl 
          Dietrich Bracher from 1969, the portrayal of the Holocaust is 
only marginal. 
          The killing of the Jews comprised only twelve pages out of 580. 
This 
          marginality repeats itself throughout almost all portrayals 
written 
          in German until the late 1980s. The research and public debate 
circled 
          around the question of the cause of the "takeover", while little 
attention 
          was paid to the war and the genocide.<a 
href="#179"><sup>179</sup></a> 
          Raul Hilberg's fundamental study of the Holocaust, which had 
already 
          been published in 1961 in its English original, was translated 
to German 
          only 21 years later.<a href="#180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
        <p>Had the judges not gotten involved personally despite the 
adverse conditions, 
          had the court not taken the effort upon itself, the Bielefeld 
proceedings 
          would have ended in an acquittal for want of evidence.</p>
        <p>The Bielefeld trial could not entirely clarify the whole extent 
of 
          the killing of the Jews in the "Bialystock district" and the 
responsibility 
          of the KdS's office.</p>
        <p> However, suspicion arose during the taking of evidence, that 
the former 
          KdS Althenloh was also responsible for deportations from other 
places 
          in the "Bialystok district". The suspected facts however could 
not be 
          clarified through an additional lawsuit, since Altenloh would 
have had 
          to agree to it according to the 266 StPO (regulations of 
criminal processes). 
          Hereupon the "Zentrale Stelle (central site) Dortmund" 
instituted new 
          preliminary proceedings against him. It accused him of arranging 
"the 
          deportation to extermination camps of 1) at least 9000 Jews from 
the 
          Pruzana Ghetto, 2) approximately 10.000 Jews from the barracks 
of the 
          10<sup>th</sup> Polish Mounted Regiment, 3) around 1000 Jews 
from the 
          former prisoners of war camp Piaski near Wolkowysk, 4) around 
1000 Jews 
          from the Ghetto of Jasionowka, on instruction of the head office 
of 
          Reich's security and in awareness of the forthcoming destiny of 
the 
          Jews. <a href="#181"><sup>181</sup></a> </p>
        <p>It also instituted new preliminary proceedings for murder 
against Heimbach 
          and Dibus.<a href="#182"><sup>182</sup></a> </p>
        <p>The trial in Bielefeld did not put an end to the clarification 
of the 
          Bialystok complex.</p>
        <p>The Bialystok trial, even though it was a big trial, did not 
rouse 
          any response, neither in the public nor in historiography. A 
bitter 
          aftertaste remains also since none of the defendants was 
sentenced as 
          "perpetrator" but only as assistant to the "main-perpetrators" - 
Hitler, 
          Himmler, Heydrich, MÅller and Kaltenbrunner. Recent historical 
research 
          of the Nazi genocide casts serious doubt on the assumption that 
the 
          Nazi-murder program was operated only by one center. It refers 
to the 
          initiative of decision makers on the periphery that bore a 
crucial responsibility 
          for the "success" of the extermination of the Jews.<a 
href="#183"><sup>183</sup></a></p>
        <p>For the Jewish survivors, who gave evidence in the Bielefeld 
trial, 
          the doubts about their credibility and the reliability of their 
personal 
          memory must have been deeply offensive. Once in the ghetto they 
were 
          defenseless at the mercy of the German "masters" and 23 years 
later 
          they sat in front of them again in the courtroom and the defense 
attorneys, 
          whose task was of course to exhaust the remedies of the defense, 
"had 
          a go on them". However, it shows that the interaction between 
judges, 
          defense counsels, prosecutors, defendants and witnesses was 
predominately 
          factual.</p>
        <p>The fair conduct of the trial by chief judge Witte is to be 
commended 
          in particular.<a href="#184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>
